# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

<sup>2</sup> God didn’t reject his people, whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:

<sup>3</sup> “Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.”[^1158]

<sup>4</sup> But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”[^1159]

<sup>5</sup> Even so too at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

<sup>6</sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.

<sup>7</sup> What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.

<sup>8</sup> According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.”[^1160]

<sup>9</sup> David says, “Let their table be made a snare, a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.

<sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Always keep their backs bent.”[^1161]

<sup>11</sup> I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.

<sup>12</sup> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!

<sup>13</sup> For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,

<sup>14</sup> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.

<sup>15</sup> For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?

<sup>16</sup> If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.

<sup>17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,

<sup>18</sup> don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.

<sup>19</sup> You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”

<sup>20</sup> True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;

<sup>21</sup> for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.

<sup>22</sup> See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.

<sup>23</sup> They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

<sup>24</sup> For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

<sup>25</sup> For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,[^1162] of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,

<sup>26</sup> and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, “There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

<sup>27</sup> This is my covenant with them, when I will take away their sins.”[^1163]

<sup>28</sup> Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.

<sup>29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

<sup>30</sup> For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,

<sup>31</sup> even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.

<sup>32</sup> For God has bound all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.

<sup>33</sup> Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!

<sup>34</sup> “For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”[^1164]

<sup>35</sup> “Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?”[^1165]

<sup>36</sup> For of him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
