# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Brothers, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved. 

<sup>2</sup> For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn’t subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 

<sup>4</sup> For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 

<sup>5</sup> For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.” 

<sup>6</sup> But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down); 

<sup>7</sup> or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)” 

<sup>8</sup> But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart;” that is, the word of faith which we preach: 

<sup>9</sup> that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 

<sup>10</sup> For with the heart one believes resulting in righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made resulting in salvation. 

<sup>11</sup> For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.” 

<sup>12</sup> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him. 

<sup>13</sup> For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.” 

<sup>14</sup> How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher? 

<sup>15</sup> And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!” 

<sup>16</sup> But they didn’t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 

<sup>17</sup> So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 

<sup>18</sup> But I say, didn’t they hear? Yes, most certainly, “Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.” 

<sup>19</sup> But I ask, didn’t Israel know? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation. I will make you angry with a nation void of understanding.” 

<sup>20</sup> Isaiah is very bold and says, “I was found by those who didn’t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn’t ask for me.” 

<sup>21</sup> But about Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
