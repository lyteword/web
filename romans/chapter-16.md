# Chapter 16

**¹** I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant[^1181] of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,

**²** that you receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.

**³** Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

**⁴** who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles.

**⁵** Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.

**⁶** Greet Mary, who labored much for us.

**⁷** Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me.

**⁸** Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.

**⁹** Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.

**¹⁰** Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.

**¹¹** Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.

**¹²** Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.

**¹³** Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

**¹⁴** Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers[^1182] who are with them.

**¹⁵** Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

**¹⁶** Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you.

**¹⁷** Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.

**¹⁸** For those who are such don’t serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the innocent.

**¹⁹** For your obedience has become known to all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.

**²⁰** And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

**²¹** Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.

**²²** I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.

**²³** Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother.

**²⁴** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.

**²⁵** [^1183]

[^1181]: 16:1 or, deacon
[^1182]: 16:14 The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
[^1183]: 16:25 TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27.
