# Chapter 12

**¹** Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.

**²** Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.

**³** For I say through the grace that was given me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.

**⁴** For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,

**⁵** so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another,

**⁶** having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;

**⁷** or service, let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;

**⁸** or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

**⁹** Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.

**¹⁰** In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor prefer one another,

**¹¹** not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,

**¹²** rejoicing in hope, enduring in troubles, continuing steadfastly in prayer,

**¹³** contributing to the needs of the saints, and given to hospitality.

**¹⁴** Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.

**¹⁵** Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.

**¹⁶** Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.

**¹⁷** Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.

**¹⁸** If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.

**¹⁹** Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.”[^1166]

**²⁰** Therefore “If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.”[^1167]

**²¹** Don’t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
