# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service. 

<sup>2</sup> Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. 

<sup>3</sup> For I say through the grace that was given me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith. 

<sup>4</sup> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function, 

<sup>5</sup> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another, 

<sup>6</sup> having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 

<sup>7</sup> or service, let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching; 

<sup>8</sup> or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 

<sup>9</sup> Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good. 

<sup>10</sup> In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor prefer one another, 

<sup>11</sup> not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, 

<sup>12</sup> rejoicing in hope, enduring in troubles, continuing steadfastly in prayer, 

<sup>13</sup> contributing to the needs of the saints, and given to hospitality. 

<sup>14</sup> Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse. 

<sup>15</sup> Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. 

<sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits. 

<sup>17</sup> Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men. 

<sup>18</sup> If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men. 

<sup>19</sup> Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” 

<sup>20</sup> Therefore “If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.” 

<sup>21</sup> Don’t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
