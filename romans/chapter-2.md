# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. 

<sup>2</sup> We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. 

<sup>3</sup> Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? 

<sup>4</sup> Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? 

<sup>5</sup> But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God, 

<sup>6</sup> who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:” 

<sup>7</sup> to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; 

<sup>8</sup> but to those who are self-seeking and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation, 

<sup>9</sup> oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 

<sup>10</sup> But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 

<sup>11</sup> For there is no partiality with God. 

<sup>12</sup> For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 

<sup>13</sup> For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified 

<sup>14</sup> (for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, 

<sup>15</sup> in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) 

<sup>16</sup> in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God, 

<sup>18</sup> know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, 

<sup>19</sup> and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 

<sup>20</sup> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. 

<sup>21</sup> You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal? 

<sup>22</sup> You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 

<sup>23</sup> You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law? 

<sup>24</sup> For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it is written. 

<sup>25</sup> For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 

<sup>26</sup> If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? 

<sup>27</sup> Won’t those who are physically uncircumcised, but fulfill the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? 

<sup>28</sup> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; 

<sup>29</sup> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
