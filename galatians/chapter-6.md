# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted. 

<sup>2</sup> Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 

<sup>4</sup> But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else. 

<sup>5</sup> For each man will bear his own burden. 

<sup>6</sup> But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches. 

<sup>7</sup> Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 

<sup>8</sup> For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 

<sup>9</sup> Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up. 

<sup>10</sup> So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. 

<sup>11</sup> See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand. 

<sup>12</sup> As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh. 

<sup>14</sup> But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 

<sup>15</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 

<sup>16</sup> As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel. 

<sup>17</sup> From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. 

<sup>18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
