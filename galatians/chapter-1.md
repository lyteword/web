# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— 

<sup>2</sup> and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— 

<sup>5</sup> to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>6</sup> I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”, 

<sup>7</sup> but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. 

<sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. 

<sup>10</sup> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. 

<sup>12</sup> For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it. 

<sup>14</sup> I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, 

<sup>16</sup> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood, 

<sup>17</sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. 

<sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother. 

<sup>20</sup> Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I’m not lying. 

<sup>21</sup> Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

<sup>22</sup> I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, 

<sup>23</sup> but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.” 

<sup>24</sup> So they glorified God in me.
