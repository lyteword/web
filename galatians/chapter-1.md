# Galatians 1 

**¹** Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,[^1232] and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—

**²** and all the brothers[^1233] who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:

**³** Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,

**⁴** who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—

**⁵** to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

**⁶** I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,

**⁷** but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.

**⁸** But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.

**⁹** As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.

**¹⁰** For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.

**¹¹** But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.

**¹²** For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.

**¹³** For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.

**¹⁴** I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

**¹⁵** But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace,

**¹⁶** to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,

**¹⁷** nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.

**¹⁸** Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.

**¹⁹** But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.

**²⁰** Now about the things which I write to you, behold,[^1234] before God, I’m not lying.

**²¹** Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

**²²** I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,

**²³** but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”

**²⁴** So they glorified God in me.

[^1232]: 1:1 “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
[^1233]: 1:2 The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
[^1234]: 1:20 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
