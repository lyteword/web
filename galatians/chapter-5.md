# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.

<sup>2</sup> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.

<sup>3</sup> Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

<sup>4</sup> You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.

<sup>5</sup> For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.

<sup>6</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.

<sup>7</sup> You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?

<sup>8</sup> This persuasion is not from him who calls you.

<sup>9</sup> A little yeast grows through the whole lump.

<sup>10</sup> I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.

<sup>11</sup> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.

<sup>12</sup> I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.

<sup>13</sup> For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.

<sup>14</sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”[^1247]

<sup>15</sup> But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.

<sup>16</sup> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.

<sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.

<sup>18</sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

<sup>19</sup> Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,

<sup>20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,

<sup>21</sup> envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.

<sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,[^1248]

<sup>23</sup> gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

<sup>24</sup> Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.

<sup>25</sup> If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.

<sup>26</sup> Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.

[^1248]: 5:22 or, faithfulness
