# Chapter 5

**¹** Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.

**²** Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.

**³** Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

**⁴** You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.

**⁵** For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.

**⁶** For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.

**⁷** You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?

**⁸** This persuasion is not from him who calls you.

**⁹** A little yeast grows through the whole lump.

**¹⁰** I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.

**¹¹** But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.

**¹²** I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.

**¹³** For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.

**¹⁴** For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”[^1247]

**¹⁵** But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.

**¹⁶** But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.

**¹⁷** For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.

**¹⁸** But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

**¹⁹** Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,

**²⁰** idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,

**²¹** envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.

**²²** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,[^1248]

**²³** gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

**²⁴** Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.

**²⁵** If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.

**²⁶** Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
