# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 

<sup>2</sup> He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute. 

<sup>3</sup> David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 

<sup>4</sup> David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots. 

<sup>5</sup> When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 

<sup>6</sup> Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. 

<sup>7</sup> David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

<sup>8</sup> From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze. 

<sup>9</sup> When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 

<sup>10</sup> he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. 

<sup>11</sup> King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 

<sup>12</sup> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 

<sup>13</sup> He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. 

<sup>14</sup> David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people. 

<sup>15</sup> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 

<sup>16</sup> Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe; 

<sup>17</sup> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king.
