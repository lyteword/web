<sup>62</sup> These sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood. 

<sup>63</sup> The governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to serve with Urim and with Thummim. 

<sup>64</sup> The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty, 

<sup>65</sup> in addition to their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. 

<sup>66</sup> Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;
