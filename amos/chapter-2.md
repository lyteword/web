# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime; 

<sup>2</sup> but I will send a fire on Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; 

<sup>3</sup> and I will cut off the judge from among them, and will kill all its princes with him,” says Yahweh. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because they have rejected Yahweh’s law, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have led them astray, after which their fathers walked; 

<sup>5</sup> but I will send a fire on Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.” 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals; 

<sup>7</sup> They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth and deny justice to the oppressed. A man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name. 

<sup>8</sup> They lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge. In the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 

<sup>10</sup> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 

<sup>11</sup> I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn’t this true, you children of Israel?” says Yahweh. 

<sup>12</sup> “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’ 

<sup>13</sup> Behold, I will crush you in your place, as a cart crushes that is full of grain. 

<sup>14</sup> Flight will perish from the swift. The strong won’t strengthen his force. The mighty won’t deliver himself. 

<sup>15</sup> He who handles the bow won’t stand. He who is swift of foot won’t escape. He who rides the horse won’t deliver himself. 

<sup>16</sup> He who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day,” says Yahweh.
