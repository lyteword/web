# Chapter 2

**¹** Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;

**²** but I will send a fire on Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;

**³** and I will cut off the judge from among them, and will kill all its princes with him,” says Yahweh.

**⁴** Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because they have rejected Yahweh’s law, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have led them astray, after which their fathers walked;

**⁵** but I will send a fire on Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”

**⁶** Yahweh says: “For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment, because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals;

**⁷** They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth and deny justice to the oppressed. A man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name.

**⁸** They lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge. In the house of their God[^596] they drink the wine of those who have been fined.

**⁹** Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

**¹⁰** Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

**¹¹** I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn’t this true, you children of Israel?” says Yahweh.

**¹²** “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’

**¹³** Behold,[^597] I will crush you in your place, as a cart crushes that is full of grain.

**¹⁴** Flight will perish from the swift. The strong won’t strengthen his force. The mighty won’t deliver himself.

**¹⁵** He who handles the bow won’t stand. He who is swift of foot won’t escape. He who rides the horse won’t deliver himself.

**¹⁶** He who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day,” says Yahweh.

[^596]: 2:8 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
[^597]: 2:13 “Behold”, from “ הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
