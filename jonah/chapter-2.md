# Jonah 2 

**¹** Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.

**²** He said, “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol[^608] I cried. You heard my voice.

**³** For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me.

**⁴** I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’

**⁵** The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head.

**⁶** I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever; yet you have brought my life up from the pit, Yahweh my God.

**⁷** “When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.

**⁸** Those who regard vain idols forsake their own mercy.

**⁹** But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh.”

**¹⁰** Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.

[^608]: 2:2 Sheol is the place of the dead.
