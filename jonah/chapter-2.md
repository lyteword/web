# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly. 

<sup>2</sup> He said, “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried. You heard my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’ 

<sup>5</sup> The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head. 

<sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever; yet you have brought my life up from the pit, Yahweh my God. 

<sup>7</sup> “When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> Those who regard vain idols forsake their own mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh.” 

<sup>10</sup> Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
