# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father; but a foolish son brings grief to his mother. 

<sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth. 

<sup>5</sup> He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> The memory of the righteous is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot. 

<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering fool will fall. 

<sup>9</sup> He who walks blamelessly walks surely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out. 

<sup>10</sup> One who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering fool will fall. 

<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all wrongs. 

<sup>13</sup> Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment, but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin. 

<sup>15</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city. The destruction of the poor is their poverty. 

<sup>16</sup> The labor of the righteous leads to life. The increase of the wicked leads to sin. 

<sup>17</sup> He is in the way of life who heeds correction, but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray. 

<sup>18</sup> He who hides hatred has lying lips. He who utters a slander is a fool. 

<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience, but he who restrains his lips does wisely. 

<sup>20</sup> The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver. The heart of the wicked is of little worth. 

<sup>21</sup> The lips of the righteous feed many, but the foolish die for lack of understanding. 

<sup>22</sup> Yahweh’s blessing brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it. 

<sup>23</sup> It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness, but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure. 

<sup>24</sup> What the wicked fear will overtake them, but the desire of the righteous will be granted. 

<sup>25</sup> When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; but the righteous stand firm forever. 

<sup>26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 

<sup>28</sup> The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hope of the wicked will perish. 

<sup>29</sup> The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>30</sup> The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the land. 

<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off. 

<sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
