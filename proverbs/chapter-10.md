<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.

<sup>4</sup> He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.

<sup>5</sup> He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.

<sup>6</sup> Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.

<sup>7</sup> The memory of the righteous is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot.

<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering fool will fall.

<sup>10</sup> One who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering fool will fall.

<sup>11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.

<sup>14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.

<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off.

<sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
