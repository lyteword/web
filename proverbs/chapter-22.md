# Chapter 22

**¹** A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving favor is better than silver and gold.

**²** The rich and the poor have this in common: Yahweh is the maker of them all.

**³** A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.

**⁴** The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth, honor, and life.

**⁵** Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked; whoever guards his soul stays far from them.

**⁶** Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.

**⁷** The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is servant to the lender.

**⁸** He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.

**⁹** He who has a generous eye will be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor.

**¹⁰** Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and insults will stop.

**¹¹** He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is the king’s friend.

**¹²** Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.

**¹³** The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!”

**¹⁴** The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit. He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it.

**¹⁵** Folly is bound up in the heart of a child; the rod of discipline drives it far from him.

**¹⁶** Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, both come to poverty.

**¹⁷** Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching.

**¹⁸** For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips.

**¹⁹** I teach you today, even you, so that your trust may be in Yahweh.

**²⁰** Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things of counsel and knowledge,

**²¹** To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?

**²²** Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor; and don’t crush the needy in court;

**²³** for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life of those who plunder them.

**²⁴** Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man. Don’t associate with one who harbors anger,

**²⁵** lest you learn his ways and ensnare your soul.

**²⁶** Don’t you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are collateral for debts.

**²⁷** If you don’t have means to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?

**²⁸** Don’t move the ancient boundary stone which your fathers have set up.

**²⁹** Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings. He won’t serve obscure men.
