# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving favor is better than silver and gold. 

<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common: Yahweh is the maker of them all. 

<sup>3</sup> A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

<sup>4</sup> The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth, honor, and life. 

<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked; whoever guards his soul stays far from them. 

<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. 

<sup>7</sup> The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is servant to the lender. 

<sup>8</sup> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. 

<sup>9</sup> He who has a generous eye will be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and insults will stop. 

<sup>11</sup> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is the king’s friend. 

<sup>12</sup> Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. 

<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!” 

<sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit. He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it. 

<sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child; the rod of discipline drives it far from him. 

<sup>16</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, both come to poverty. 

<sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching. 

<sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips. 

<sup>19</sup> I teach you today, even you, so that your trust may be in Yahweh. 

<sup>20</sup> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things of counsel and knowledge, 

<sup>21</sup> To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers to the ones who sent you? 

<sup>22</sup> Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor; and don’t crush the needy in court; 

<sup>23</sup> for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life of those who plunder them. 

<sup>24</sup> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man. Don’t associate with one who harbors anger, 

<sup>25</sup> lest you learn his ways and ensnare your soul. 

<sup>26</sup> Don’t you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are collateral for debts. 

<sup>27</sup> If you don’t have means to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you? 

<sup>28</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone which your fathers have set up. 

<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings. He won’t serve obscure men.
