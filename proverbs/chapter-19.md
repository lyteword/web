# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge, nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way. 

<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart rages against Yahweh. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free. 

<sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> All the relatives of the poor shun him; how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. 

<sup>8</sup> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who utters lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook an offense. 

<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping. 

<sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh. 

<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. 

<sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him. 

<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for there is hope; don’t be a willing party to his death. 

<sup>19</sup> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end. 

<sup>21</sup> There are many plans in a man’s heart, but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail. 

<sup>22</sup> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests and will not be touched by trouble. 

<sup>24</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> He who robs his father and drives away his mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
