# Chapter 19

**¹** Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.

**²** It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty with one’s feet and miss the way.

**³** The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart rages against Yahweh.

**⁴** Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.

**⁵** A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free.

**⁶** Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.

**⁷** All the relatives of the poor shun him; how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.

**⁸** He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good.

**⁹** A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who utters lies shall perish.

**¹⁰** Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

**¹¹** The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook an offense.

**¹²** The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.

**¹³** A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.

**¹⁴** House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.

**¹⁵** Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger.

**¹⁶** He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.

**¹⁷** He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.

**¹⁸** Discipline your son, for there is hope; don’t be a willing party to his death.

**¹⁹** A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again.

**²⁰** Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end.

**²¹** There are many plans in a man’s heart, but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail.

**²²** That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar.

**²³** The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests and will not be touched by trouble.

**²⁴** The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

**²⁵** Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.

**²⁶** He who robs his father and drives away his mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.

**²⁷** If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge.

**²⁸** A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.

**²⁹** Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
