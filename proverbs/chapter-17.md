# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full of feasting with strife. 

<sup>2</sup> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers. 

<sup>3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but Yahweh tests the hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> An evildoer heeds wicked lips. A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> Children’s children are the crown of old men; the glory of children is their parents. 

<sup>7</sup> Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool, much less do lying lips fit a prince. 

<sup>8</sup> A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he turns, he prospers. 

<sup>9</sup> He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats a matter separates best friends. 

<sup>10</sup> A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than a hundred lashes into a fool. 

<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 

<sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 

<sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out. 

<sup>15</sup> He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. 

<sup>16</sup> Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, since he has no understanding? 

<sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity. 

<sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor. 

<sup>19</sup> He who loves disobedience loves strife. One who builds a high gate seeks destruction. 

<sup>20</sup> One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity, and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble. 

<sup>21</sup> He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. The father of a fool has no joy. 

<sup>22</sup> A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. 

<sup>23</sup> A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert the ways of justice. 

<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>25</sup> A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him. 

<sup>26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials for their integrity. 

<sup>27</sup> He who spares his words has knowledge. He who is even tempered is a man of understanding. 

<sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
