# Proverbs 17 

**¹** Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full of feasting with strife.

**²** A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.

**³** The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but Yahweh tests the hearts.

**⁴** An evildoer heeds wicked lips. A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.

**⁵** Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.

**⁶** Children’s children are the crown of old men; the glory of children is their parents.

**⁷** Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool, much less do lying lips fit a prince.

**⁸** A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he turns, he prospers.

**⁹** He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.

**¹⁰** A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than a hundred lashes into a fool.

**¹¹** An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.

**¹²** Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.

**¹³** Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

**¹⁴** The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.

**¹⁵** He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.

**¹⁶** Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, since he has no understanding?

**¹⁷** A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity.

**¹⁸** A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.

**¹⁹** He who loves disobedience loves strife. One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.

**²⁰** One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity, and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.

**²¹** He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. The father of a fool has no joy.

**²²** A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.

**²³** A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert the ways of justice.

**²⁴** Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.

**²⁵** A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him.

**²⁶** Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials for their integrity.

**²⁷** He who spares his words has knowledge. He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.

**²⁸** Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
