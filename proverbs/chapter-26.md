# Chapter 26

**¹** Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.

**²** Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow, so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.

**³** A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools!

**⁴** Don’t answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him.

**⁵** Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.

**⁶** One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off feet and drinking violence.

**⁷** Like the legs of the lame that hang loose, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

**⁸** As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool.

**⁹** Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

**¹⁰** As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by.

**¹¹** As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a fool who repeats his folly.

**¹²** Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

**¹³** The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!”

**¹⁴** As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.

**¹⁵** The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.

**¹⁶** The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer with discretion.

**¹⁷** Like one who grabs a dog’s ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.

**¹⁸** Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,

**¹⁹** is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”

**²⁰** For lack of wood a fire goes out. Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.

**²¹** As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindling strife.

**²²** The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down into the innermost parts.

**²³** Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.

**²⁴** A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors evil in his heart.

**²⁵** When his speech is charming, don’t believe him, for there are seven abominations in his heart.

**²⁶** His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.

**²⁷** Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.

**²⁸** A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering mouth works ruin.
