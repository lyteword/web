# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doesn’t wisdom cry out? Doesn’t understanding raise her voice? 

<sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands. 

<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors, she cries aloud: 

<sup>4</sup> “I call to you men! I send my voice to the sons of mankind. 

<sup>5</sup> You simple, understand prudence! You fools, be of an understanding heart! 

<sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things. 

<sup>7</sup> For my mouth speaks truth. Wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. 

<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him who understands, right to those who find knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 

<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies. All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it. 

<sup>12</sup> “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. Find out knowledge and discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. I have understanding and power. 

<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 

<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule, nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> I love those who love me. Those who seek me diligently will find me. 

<sup>18</sup> With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity. 

<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, my yield than choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of justice, 

<sup>21</sup> that I may give wealth to those who love me. I fill their treasuries. 

<sup>22</sup> “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his deeds of old. 

<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth existed. 

<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was born, when there were no springs abounding with water. 

<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was born; 

<sup>26</sup> while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world. 

<sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there. When he set a circle on the surface of the deep, 

<sup>28</sup> when he established the clouds above, when the springs of the deep became strong, 

<sup>29</sup> when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, 

<sup>30</sup> then I was the craftsman by his side. I was a delight day by day, always rejoicing before him, 

<sup>31</sup> rejoicing in his whole world. My delight was with the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise. Don’t refuse it. 

<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my door posts. 

<sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh. 

<sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death.”
