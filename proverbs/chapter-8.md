# Chapter 8

**¹** Doesn’t wisdom cry out? Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?

**²** On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands.

**³** Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors, she cries aloud:

**⁴** “I call to you men! I send my voice to the sons of mankind.

**⁵** You simple, understand prudence! You fools, be of an understanding heart!

**⁶** Hear, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things.

**⁷** For my mouth speaks truth. Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

**⁸** All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.

**⁹** They are all plain to him who understands, right to those who find knowledge.

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold.

**¹¹** For wisdom is better than rubies. All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.

**¹²** “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. Find out knowledge and discretion.

**¹³** The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.

**¹⁴** Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. I have understanding and power.

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

**¹⁶** By me princes rule, nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.

**¹⁷** I love those who love me. Those who seek me diligently will find me.

**¹⁸** With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.

**¹⁹** My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, my yield than choice silver.

**²⁰** I walk in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of justice,

**²¹** that I may give wealth to those who love me. I fill their treasuries.

**²²** “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his deeds of old.

**²³** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth existed.

**²⁴** When there were no depths, I was born, when there were no springs abounding with water.

**²⁵** Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was born;

**²⁶** while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.

**²⁷** When he established the heavens, I was there. When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,

**²⁸** when he established the clouds above, when the springs of the deep became strong,

**²⁹** when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,

**³⁰** then I was the craftsman by his side. I was a delight day by day, always rejoicing before him,

**³¹** rejoicing in his whole world. My delight was with the sons of men.

**³²** “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.

**³³** Hear instruction, and be wise. Don’t refuse it.

**³⁴** Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my door posts.

**³⁵** For whoever finds me finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh.

**³⁶** But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death.”
