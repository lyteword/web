# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy. 

<sup>2</sup> When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan. 

<sup>3</sup> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. 

<sup>4</sup> The king by justice makes the land stable, but he who takes bribes tears it down. 

<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet. 

<sup>6</sup> An evil man is snared by his sin, but the righteous can sing and be glad. 

<sup>7</sup> The righteous care about justice for the poor. The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge. 

<sup>8</sup> Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger. 

<sup>9</sup> If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace. 

<sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life of the upright. 

<sup>11</sup> A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings himself under control. 

<sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked. 

<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both. 

<sup>14</sup> The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall be established forever. 

<sup>15</sup> The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother. 

<sup>16</sup> When the wicked increase, sin increases; but the righteous will see their downfall. 

<sup>17</sup> Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring delight to your soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but one who keeps the law is blessed. 

<sup>19</sup> A servant can’t be corrected by words. Though he understands, yet he will not respond. 

<sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 

<sup>21</sup> He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become a son in the end. 

<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin. 

<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride brings him low, but one of lowly spirit gains honor. 

<sup>24</sup> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul. He takes an oath, but dares not testify. 

<sup>25</sup> The fear of man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe. 

<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh. 

<sup>27</sup> A dishonest man detests the righteous, and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
