# Chapter 29

**¹** He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.

**²** When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan.

**³** Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.

**⁴** The king by justice makes the land stable, but he who takes bribes tears it down.

**⁵** A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.

**⁶** An evil man is snared by his sin, but the righteous can sing and be glad.

**⁷** The righteous care about justice for the poor. The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.

**⁸** Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.

**⁹** If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.

**¹⁰** The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life of the upright.

**¹¹** A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings himself under control.

**¹²** If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked.

**¹³** The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.

**¹⁴** The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall be established forever.

**¹⁵** The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.

**¹⁶** When the wicked increase, sin increases; but the righteous will see their downfall.

**¹⁷** Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring delight to your soul.

**¹⁸** Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but one who keeps the law is blessed.

**¹⁹** A servant can’t be corrected by words. Though he understands, yet he will not respond.

**²⁰** Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

**²¹** He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become a son in the end.

**²²** An angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin.

**²³** A man’s pride brings him low, but one of lowly spirit gains honor.

**²⁴** Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul. He takes an oath, but dares not testify.

**²⁵** The fear of man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe.

**²⁶** Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh.

**²⁷** A dishonest man detests the righteous, and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
