# Proverbs 11 

**¹** A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate weights are his delight.

**²** When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom.

**³** The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.

**⁴** Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.

**⁵** The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

**⁶** The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.

**⁷** When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power comes to nothing.

**⁸** A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked takes his place.

**⁹** With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.

**¹⁰** When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices. When the wicked perish, there is shouting.

**¹¹** By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

**¹²** One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man of understanding holds his peace.

**¹³** One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.

**¹⁴** Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in the multitude of counselors there is victory.

**¹⁵** He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it, but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.

**¹⁶** A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches.

**¹⁷** The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.

**¹⁸** Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.

**¹⁹** He who is truly righteous gets life. He who pursues evil gets death.

**²⁰** Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh, but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.

**²¹** Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished, but the offspring[^474] of the righteous will be delivered.

**²²** Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout, is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.

**²³** The desire of the righteous is only good. The expectation of the wicked is wrath.

**²⁴** There is one who scatters, and increases yet more. There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.

**²⁵** The liberal soul shall be made fat. He who waters shall be watered also himself.

**²⁶** People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.

**²⁷** He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.

**²⁸** He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.

**²⁹** He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.

**³⁰** The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. He who is wise wins souls.

**³¹** Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner!
