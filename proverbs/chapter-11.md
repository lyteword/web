# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate weights are his delight. 

<sup>2</sup> When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom. 

<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. 

<sup>4</sup> Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. 

<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires. 

<sup>7</sup> When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power comes to nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked takes his place. 

<sup>9</sup> With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices. When the wicked perish, there is shouting. 

<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man of understanding holds his peace. 

<sup>13</sup> One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret. 

<sup>14</sup> Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in the multitude of counselors there is victory. 

<sup>15</sup> He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it, but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure. 

<sup>16</sup> A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches. 

<sup>17</sup> The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh. 

<sup>18</sup> Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. 

<sup>19</sup> He who is truly righteous gets life. He who pursues evil gets death. 

<sup>20</sup> Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh, but those whose ways are blameless are his delight. 

<sup>21</sup> Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered. 

<sup>22</sup> Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout, is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. 

<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good. The expectation of the wicked is wrath. 

<sup>24</sup> There is one who scatters, and increases yet more. There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty. 

<sup>25</sup> The liberal soul shall be made fat. He who waters shall be watered also himself. 

<sup>26</sup> People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it. 

<sup>27</sup> He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him. 

<sup>28</sup> He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. 

<sup>29</sup> He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind. The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. 

<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life. He who is wise wins souls. 

<sup>31</sup> Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner!
