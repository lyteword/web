# Chapter 18

**¹** A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment.

**²** A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing his own opinion.

**³** When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with shame comes disgrace.

**⁴** The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters. The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.

**⁵** To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good, nor to deprive the innocent of justice.

**⁶** A fool’s lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings.

**⁷** A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare to his soul.

**⁸** The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels: they go down into a person’s innermost parts.

**⁹** One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction.

**¹⁰** Yahweh’s name is a strong tower: the righteous run to him, and are safe.

**¹¹** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.

**¹²** Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before honor is humility.

**¹³** He who answers before he hears, that is folly and shame to him.

**¹⁴** A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit, who can bear?

**¹⁵** The heart of the discerning gets knowledge. The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.

**¹⁶** A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.

**¹⁷** He who pleads his cause first seems right— until another comes and questions him.

**¹⁸** The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart.

**¹⁹** A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city. Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.

**²⁰** A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth. With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.

**²¹** Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love it will eat its fruit.

**²²** Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor of Yahweh.

**²³** The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.

**²⁴** A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
