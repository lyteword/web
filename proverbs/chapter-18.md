# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment. 

<sup>2</sup> A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing his own opinion. 

<sup>3</sup> When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with shame comes disgrace. 

<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters. The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook. 

<sup>5</sup> To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good, nor to deprive the innocent of justice. 

<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings. 

<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare to his soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels: they go down into a person’s innermost parts. 

<sup>9</sup> One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction. 

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh’s name is a strong tower: the righteous run to him, and are safe. 

<sup>11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable wall in his own imagination. 

<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before honor is humility. 

<sup>13</sup> He who answers before he hears, that is folly and shame to him. 

<sup>14</sup> A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit, who can bear? 

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the discerning gets knowledge. The ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 

<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men. 

<sup>17</sup> He who pleads his cause first seems right— until another comes and questions him. 

<sup>18</sup> The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart. 

<sup>19</sup> A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city. Disputes are like the bars of a fortress. 

<sup>20</sup> A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth. With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. 

<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love it will eat its fruit. 

<sup>22</sup> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor of Yahweh. 

<sup>23</sup> The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly. 

<sup>24</sup> A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
