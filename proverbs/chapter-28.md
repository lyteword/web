# Chapter 28

**¹** The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

**²** In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.

**³** A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.

**⁴** Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep the law contend with them.

**⁵** Evil men don’t understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.

**⁶** Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.

**⁷** Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.

**⁸** He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.

**⁹** He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.

**¹⁰** Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.

**¹¹** The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding sees through him.

**¹²** When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.

**¹³** He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.

**¹⁴** Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.

**¹⁵** As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.

**¹⁶** A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.

**¹⁷** A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death. No one will support him.

**¹⁸** Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.

**¹⁹** One who works his land will have an abundance of food; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.

**²⁰** A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.

**²¹** To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.

**²²** A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.

**²³** One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue.

**²⁴** Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” is a partner with a destroyer.

**²⁵** One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.

**²⁶** One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.

**²⁷** One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.

**²⁸** When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
