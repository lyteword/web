# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

<sup>2</sup> In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.

<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep the law contend with them.

<sup>5</sup> Evil men don’t understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.

<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.

<sup>7</sup> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.

<sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.

<sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.

<sup>10</sup> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.

<sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding sees through him.

<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.

<sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.

<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.

<sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.

<sup>16</sup> A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.

<sup>17</sup> A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death. No one will support him.

<sup>18</sup> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.

<sup>19</sup> One who works his land will have an abundance of food; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.

<sup>20</sup> A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.

<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.

<sup>22</sup> A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.

<sup>23</sup> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue.

<sup>24</sup> Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” is a partner with a destroyer.

<sup>25</sup> One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.

<sup>26</sup> One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.

<sup>27</sup> One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.

<sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
