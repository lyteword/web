**¹** A wise son listens to his father’s instruction, but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.

**⁴** The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.

**⁵** A righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.

**⁶** Righteousness guards the way of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.

**¹⁷** A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy envoy gains healing.

**¹⁸** Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline, but he who heeds correction shall be honored.

**²⁰** One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm.

**²¹** Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous.

**²⁵** The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul, but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
