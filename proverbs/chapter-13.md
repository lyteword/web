# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> A wise son listens to his father’s instruction, but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke. 

<sup>2</sup> By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things, but the unfaithful crave violence. 

<sup>3</sup> He who guards his mouth guards his soul. One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. 

<sup>4</sup> The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied. 

<sup>5</sup> A righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace. 

<sup>6</sup> Righteousness guards the way of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner. 

<sup>7</sup> There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing. There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth. 

<sup>8</sup> The ransom of a man’s life is his riches, but the poor hear no threats. 

<sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out. 

<sup>10</sup> Pride only breeds quarrels, but wisdom is with people who take advice. 

<sup>11</sup> Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away, but he who gathers by hand makes it grow. 

<sup>12</sup> Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoever despises instruction will pay for it, but he who respects a command will be rewarded. 

<sup>14</sup> The teaching of the wise is a spring of life, to turn from the snares of death. 

<sup>15</sup> Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful is hard. 

<sup>16</sup> Every prudent man acts from knowledge, but a fool exposes folly. 

<sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy envoy gains healing. 

<sup>18</sup> Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline, but he who heeds correction shall be honored. 

<sup>19</sup> Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil. 

<sup>20</sup> One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm. 

<sup>21</sup> Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous. 

<sup>22</sup> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous. 

<sup>23</sup> An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields, but injustice sweeps it away. 

<sup>24</sup> One who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves him is careful to discipline him. 

<sup>25</sup> The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul, but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
