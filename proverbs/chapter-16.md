# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh. 

<sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the motives. 

<sup>3</sup> Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh has made everything for its own end— yes, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh; they shall certainly not be unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil. 

<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues with injustice. 

<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps. 

<sup>10</sup> Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. He shall not betray his mouth. 

<sup>11</sup> Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s; all the weights in the bag are his work. 

<sup>12</sup> It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne is established by righteousness. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings. They value one who speaks the truth. 

<sup>14</sup> The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it. 

<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king’s face is life. His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain. 

<sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the plunder with the proud. 

<sup>20</sup> He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed. 

<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent. Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction. 

<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, but the punishment of fools is their folly. 

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

<sup>25</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. 

<sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man labors for him, for his mouth urges him on. 

<sup>27</sup> A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire. 

<sup>28</sup> A perverse man stirs up strife. A whisperer separates close friends. 

<sup>29</sup> A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way that is not good. 

<sup>30</sup> One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil. 

<sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of glory. It is attained by a life of righteousness. 

<sup>32</sup> One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city. 

<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh.
