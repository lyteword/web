# Proverbs 16 

**¹** The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.

**²** All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the motives.

**³** Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed.

**⁴** Yahweh has made everything for its own end— yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.

**⁵** Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh; they shall certainly not be unpunished.

**⁶** By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.

**⁷** When a man’s ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.

**⁸** Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues with injustice.

**⁹** A man’s heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps.

**¹⁰** Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. He shall not betray his mouth.

**¹¹** Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s; all the weights in the bag are his work.

**¹²** It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne is established by righteousness.

**¹³** Righteous lips are the delight of kings. They value one who speaks the truth.

**¹⁴** The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.

**¹⁵** In the light of the king’s face is life. His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.

**¹⁶** How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.

**¹⁷** The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul.

**¹⁸** Pride goes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall.

**¹⁹** It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the plunder with the proud.

**²⁰** He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.

**²¹** The wise in heart shall be called prudent. Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.

**²²** Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, but the punishment of fools is their folly.

**²³** The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning to his lips.

**²⁴** Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.

**²⁵** There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

**²⁶** The appetite of the laboring man labors for him, for his mouth urges him on.

**²⁷** A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire.

**²⁸** A perverse man stirs up strife. A whisperer separates close friends.

**²⁹** A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way that is not good.

**³⁰** One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.

**³¹** Gray hair is a crown of glory. It is attained by a life of righteousness.

**³²** One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.

**³³** The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh.
