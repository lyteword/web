# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding; 

<sup>2</sup> for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my law. 

<sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother. 

<sup>4</sup> He taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live. 

<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you. 

<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor when you embrace her. 

<sup>9</sup> She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.” 

<sup>10</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many. 

<sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths. 

<sup>12</sup> When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble. 

<sup>13</sup> Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life. 

<sup>14</sup> Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men. 

<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on. 

<sup>16</sup> For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall. 

<sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 

<sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light that shines more and more until the perfect day. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the center of your heart. 

<sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body. 

<sup>23</sup> Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life. 

<sup>24</sup> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you. 

<sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you. 

<sup>26</sup> Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established. 

<sup>27</sup> Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.
