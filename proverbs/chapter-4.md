# Proverbs 4 

**¹** Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;

**²** for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my law.

**³** For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.

**⁴** He taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.

**⁵** Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.

**⁶** Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you.

**⁷** Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.

**⁸** Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor when you embrace her.

**⁹** She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”

**¹⁰** Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many.

**¹¹** I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.

**¹²** When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble.

**¹³** Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life.

**¹⁴** Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men.

**¹⁵** Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.

**¹⁶** For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.

**¹⁷** For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

**¹⁸** But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light that shines more and more until the perfect day.

**¹⁹** The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over.

**²⁰** My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings.

**²¹** Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the center of your heart.

**²²** For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body.

**²³** Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life.

**²⁴** Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.

**²⁵** Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.

**²⁶** Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.

**²⁷** Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.
