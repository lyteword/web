# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands. 

<sup>2</sup> He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is perverse in his ways despises him. 

<sup>3</sup> The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them. 

<sup>4</sup> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but much increase is by the strength of the ox. 

<sup>5</sup> A truthful witness will not lie, but a false witness pours out lies. 

<sup>6</sup> A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it, but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person. 

<sup>7</sup> Stay away from a foolish man, for you won’t find knowledge on his lips. 

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way, but the folly of fools is deceit. 

<sup>9</sup> Fools mock at making atonement for sins, but among the upright there is good will. 

<sup>10</sup> The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; he will not share these with a stranger. 

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked will be overthrown, but the tent of the upright will flourish. 

<sup>12</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. 

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may end in heaviness. 

<sup>14</sup> The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways. 

<sup>15</sup> A simple man believes everything, but the prudent man carefully considers his ways. 

<sup>16</sup> A wise man fears and shuns evil, but the fool is hot headed and reckless. 

<sup>17</sup> He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty man is hated. 

<sup>18</sup> The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

<sup>19</sup> The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

<sup>20</sup> The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor, but the rich person has many friends. 

<sup>21</sup> He who despises his neighbor sins, but he who has pity on the poor is blessed. 

<sup>22</sup> Don’t they go astray who plot evil? But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good. 

<sup>23</sup> In all hard work there is profit, but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty. 

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools crowns them with folly. 

<sup>25</sup> A truthful witness saves souls, but a false witness is deceitful. 

<sup>26</sup> In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, and he will be a refuge for his children. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, turning people from the snares of death. 

<sup>28</sup> In the multitude of people is the king’s glory, but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince. 

<sup>29</sup> He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a quick temper displays folly. 

<sup>30</sup> The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker, but he who is kind to the needy honors him. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked is brought down in his calamity, but in death, the righteous has a refuge. 

<sup>33</sup> Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, and is even made known in the inward part of fools. 

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people. 

<sup>35</sup> The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely, but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
