# Chapter 14

**¹** Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

**²** He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.

**³** The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them.

**⁴** Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but much increase is by the strength of the ox.

**⁵** A truthful witness will not lie, but a false witness pours out lies.

**⁶** A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it, but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person.

**⁷** Stay away from a foolish man, for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.

**⁸** The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way, but the folly of fools is deceit.

**¹⁰** The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; he will not share these with a stranger.

**¹¹** The house of the wicked will be overthrown, but the tent of the upright will flourish.

**¹²** There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

**¹³** Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may end in heaviness.

**¹⁴** The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways.

**¹⁵** A simple man believes everything, but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.

**¹⁶** A wise man fears and shuns evil, but the fool is hot headed and reckless.

**¹⁷** He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty man is hated.

**¹⁸** The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

**¹⁹** The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

**²⁰** The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor, but the rich person has many friends.

**²¹** He who despises his neighbor sins, but he who has pity on the poor is blessed.

**²²** Don’t they go astray who plot evil? But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good.

**²³** In all hard work there is profit, but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty.

**²⁴** The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools crowns them with folly.

**²⁵** A truthful witness saves souls, but a false witness is deceitful.

**²⁶** In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, and he will be a refuge for his children.

**²⁷** The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, turning people from the snares of death.

**²⁸** In the multitude of people is the king’s glory, but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince.

**²⁹** He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has a quick temper displays folly.

**³⁰** The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones.

**³¹** He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker, but he who is kind to the needy honors him.

**³²** The wicked is brought down in his calamity, but in death, the righteous has a refuge.

**³³** Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, and is even made known in the inward part of fools.

**³⁴** Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.

**³⁵** The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely, but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
