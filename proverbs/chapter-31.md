# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:

<sup>2</sup> “Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows!

<sup>3</sup> Don’t give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.

<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’

<sup>5</sup> lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.

<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter in soul.

<sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate.

<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

<sup>10</sup> [^480]Who can find a worthy woman? For her value is far above rubies.

<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her. He shall have no lack of gain.

<sup>12</sup> She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.

<sup>13</sup> She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.

<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar.

<sup>15</sup> She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household, and portions for her servant girls.

<sup>16</sup> She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.

<sup>17</sup> She arms her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.

<sup>18</sup> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.

<sup>19</sup> She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.

<sup>20</sup> She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy.

<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.

<sup>22</sup> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple.

<sup>23</sup> Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.

<sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes to the merchant.

<sup>25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come.

<sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom. Kind instruction is on her tongue.

<sup>27</sup> She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.

<sup>28</sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:

<sup>29</sup> “Many women do noble things, but you excel them all.”

<sup>30</sup> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.

<sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her works praise her in the gates!

[^480]: 31:10 Proverbs 31:10-31 form an acrostic, with each verse starting with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order.
