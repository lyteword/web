# Proverbs 31 

**¹** The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:

**²** “Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows!

**³** Don’t give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.

**⁴** It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’

**⁵** lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.

**⁶** Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, and wine to the bitter in soul.

**⁷** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

**⁸** Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate.

**⁹** Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

**¹⁰** [^480]Who can find a worthy woman? For her value is far above rubies.

**¹¹** The heart of her husband trusts in her. He shall have no lack of gain.

**¹²** She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.

**¹³** She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.

**¹⁴** She is like the merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar.

**¹⁵** She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household, and portions for her servant girls.

**¹⁶** She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.

**¹⁷** She arms her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.

**¹⁸** She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.

**¹⁹** She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.

**²⁰** She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy.

**²¹** She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.

**²²** She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple.

**²³** Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.

**²⁴** She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes to the merchant.

**²⁵** Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come.

**²⁶** She opens her mouth with wisdom. Kind instruction is on her tongue.

**²⁷** She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.

**²⁸** Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:

**²⁹** “Many women do noble things, but you excel them all.”

**³⁰** Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.

**³¹** Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her works praise her in the gates!
