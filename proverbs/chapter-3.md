# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, don’t forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, 

<sup>2</sup> for they will add to you length of days, years of life, and peace. 

<sup>3</sup> Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 

<sup>5</sup> Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding. 

<sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. 

<sup>7</sup> Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil. 

<sup>8</sup> It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones. 

<sup>9</sup> Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase; 

<sup>10</sup> so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, neither be weary of his correction; 

<sup>12</sup> for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights. 

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her return is better than fine gold. 

<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her. 

<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor. 

<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace. 

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her. 

<sup>19</sup> By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens. 

<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion, 

<sup>22</sup> so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck. 

<sup>23</sup> Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble. 

<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet. 

<sup>25</sup> Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes; 

<sup>26</sup> for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken. 

<sup>27</sup> Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it. 

<sup>28</sup> Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you,” when you have it by you. 

<sup>29</sup> Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you. 

<sup>30</sup> Don’t strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm. 

<sup>31</sup> Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways. 

<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship is with the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. 

<sup>34</sup> Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble. 

<sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion of fools.
