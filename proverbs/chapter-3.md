# Chapter 3

**¹** My son, don’t forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,

**²** for they will add to you length of days, years of life, and peace.

**³** Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.

**⁴** So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

**⁵** Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding.

**⁶** In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.

**⁷** Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.

**⁸** It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.

**⁹** Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase;

**¹⁰** so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.

**¹¹** My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, neither be weary of his correction;

**¹²** for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.

**¹³** Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.

**¹⁴** For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her return is better than fine gold.

**¹⁵** She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.

**¹⁶** Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.

**¹⁷** Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.

**¹⁸** She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.

**¹⁹** By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.

**²⁰** By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.

**²¹** My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion,

**²²** so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.

**²³** Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble.

**²⁴** When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.

**²⁵** Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;

**²⁶** for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken.

**²⁷** Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.

**²⁸** Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you,” when you have it by you.

**²⁹** Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you.

**³⁰** Don’t strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.

**³¹** Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.

**³²** For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship is with the upright.

**³³** Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.

**³⁴** Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.

**³⁵** The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion of fools.
