# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise. 

<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion. He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. 

<sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling. 

<sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. 

<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out. 

<sup>6</sup> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find a faithful man? 

<sup>7</sup> A righteous man walks in integrity. Blessed are his children after him. 

<sup>8</sup> A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. I am clean and without sin”? 

<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. 

<sup>11</sup> Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his work is pure, and whether it is right. 

<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even both of them. 

<sup>13</sup> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty. Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>14</sup> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. 

<sup>15</sup> There is gold and abundance of rubies, but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. 

<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman. 

<sup>17</sup> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. 

<sup>18</sup> Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war! 

<sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips. 

<sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. 

<sup>21</sup> An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning won’t be blessed in the end. 

<sup>22</sup> Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you. 

<sup>23</sup> Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing. 

<sup>24</sup> A man’s steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way? 

<sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later to consider his vows. 

<sup>26</sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing wheel over them. 

<sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp, searching all his innermost parts. 

<sup>28</sup> Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by love. 

<sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength. The splendor of old men is their gray hair. 

<sup>30</sup> Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the innermost parts.
