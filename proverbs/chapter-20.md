# Proverbs 20 

**¹** Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.

**²** The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion. He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.

**³** It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling.

**⁴** The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.

**⁵** Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out.

**⁶** Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find a faithful man?

**⁷** A righteous man walks in integrity. Blessed are his children after him.

**⁸** A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.

**⁹** Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. I am clean and without sin”?

**¹⁰** Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.

**¹¹** Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.

**¹²** The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even both of them.

**¹³** Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty. Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.

**¹⁴** “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.

**¹⁵** There is gold and abundance of rubies, but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.

**¹⁶** Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.

**¹⁷** Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.

**¹⁸** Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!

**¹⁹** He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.

**²⁰** Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.

**²¹** An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning won’t be blessed in the end.

**²²** Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you.

**²³** Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing.

**²⁴** A man’s steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way?

**²⁵** It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later to consider his vows.

**²⁶** A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing wheel over them.

**²⁷** The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp, searching all his innermost parts.

**²⁸** Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by love.

**²⁹** The glory of young men is their strength. The splendor of old men is their gray hair.

**³⁰** Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the innermost parts.
