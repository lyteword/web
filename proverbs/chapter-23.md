# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you;

<sup>2</sup> put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite.

<sup>3</sup> Don’t be desirous of his dainties, since they are deceitful food.

<sup>4</sup> Don’t weary yourself to be rich. In your wisdom, show restraint.

<sup>5</sup> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.

<sup>6</sup> Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don’t crave his delicacies,

<sup>7</sup> for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.

<sup>8</sup> You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.

<sup>9</sup> Don’t speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

<sup>10</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone. Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,

<sup>11</sup> for their Defender is strong. He will plead their case against you.

<sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> Don’t withhold correction from a child. If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.

<sup>14</sup> Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol.[^477]

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine.

<sup>16</sup> Yes, my heart will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.

<sup>17</sup> Don’t let your heart envy sinners, but rather fear Yahweh all day long.

<sup>18</sup> Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not be cut off.

<sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!

<sup>20</sup> Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat;

<sup>21</sup> for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; and drowsiness clothes them in rags.

<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life, and don’t despise your mother when she is old.

<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.

<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous has great joy. Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.

<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad! Let her who bore you rejoice!

<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways.

<sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is a narrow well.

<sup>28</sup> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful among men.

<sup>29</sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?

<sup>30</sup> Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek out mixed wine.

<sup>31</sup> Don’t look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.

<sup>32</sup> In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper.

<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will imagine confusing things.

<sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he who lies on top of the rigging:

<sup>35</sup> “They hit me, and I was not hurt! They beat me, and I don’t feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I will look for more.”

[^477]: 23:14 Sheol is the place of the dead.
