# Chapter 9

**¹** Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars.

**²** She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table.

**³** She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city:

**⁴** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

**⁵** “Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!

**⁶** Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.”

**⁷** One who corrects a mocker invites insult. One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.

**⁸** Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.

**⁹** Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser. Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.

**¹⁰** The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

**¹¹** For by me your days will be multiplied. The years of your life will be increased.

**¹²** If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. If you mock, you alone will bear it.

**¹³** The foolish woman is loud, undisciplined, and knows nothing.

**¹⁴** She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

**¹⁵** to call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,

**¹⁶** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

**¹⁷** “Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”

**¹⁸** But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.[^473]

[^473]: 9:18 Sheol is the place of the dead.
