# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table. 

<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city: 

<sup>4</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, 

<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed! 

<sup>6</sup> Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.” 

<sup>7</sup> One who corrects a mocker invites insult. One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse. 

<sup>8</sup> Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise person, and he will love you. 

<sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser. Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be multiplied. The years of your life will be increased. 

<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. If you mock, you alone will bear it. 

<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is loud, undisciplined, and knows nothing. 

<sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 

<sup>15</sup> to call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways, 

<sup>16</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, 

<sup>17</sup> “Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.” 

<sup>18</sup> But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
