# Chapter 1

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:

**²** to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;

**³** to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;

**⁴** to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man—

**⁵** that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;

**⁶** to understand a proverb and parables, the words and riddles of the wise.

**⁷** The fear of Yahweh[^467] is the beginning of knowledge, but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.

**⁸** My son, listen to your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching;

**⁹** for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck.

**¹⁰** My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent.

**¹¹** If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lie in wait for blood. Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.

**¹²** Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,[^468] and whole, like those who go down into the pit.

**¹³** We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder.

**¹⁴** You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse”—

**¹⁵** my son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path,

**¹⁶** for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.

**¹⁷** For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;

**¹⁸** but these lay in wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.

**¹⁹** So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.

**²⁰** Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.

**²¹** She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:

**²²** “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge?

**²³** Turn at my reproof. Behold,[^469] I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.

**²⁴** Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;

**²⁵** but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;

**²⁶** I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you,

**²⁷** when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come on you.

**²⁸** Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,

**²⁹** because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.

**³⁰** They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.

**³¹** Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.

**³²** For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.

**³³** But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”

[^467]: 1:7 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
[^468]: 1:12 Sheol is the place of the dead.
[^469]: 1:23 “Behold”, from “ הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
