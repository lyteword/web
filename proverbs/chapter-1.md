# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding; 

<sup>3</sup> to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; 

<sup>4</sup> to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man— 

<sup>5</sup> that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel; 

<sup>6</sup> to understand a proverb and parables, the words and riddles of the wise. 

<sup>7</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge, but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 

<sup>8</sup> My son, listen to your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching; 

<sup>9</sup> for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck. 

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent. 

<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lie in wait for blood. Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. 

<sup>12</sup> Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit. 

<sup>13</sup> We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder. 

<sup>14</sup> You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse”— 

<sup>15</sup> my son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path, 

<sup>16</sup> for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood. 

<sup>17</sup> For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; 

<sup>18</sup> but these lay in wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives. 

<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners. 

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares. 

<sup>21</sup> She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: 

<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge? 

<sup>23</sup> Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you. 

<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; 

<sup>25</sup> but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof; 

<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you, 

<sup>27</sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come on you. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, 

<sup>29</sup> because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh. 

<sup>30</sup> They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof. 

<sup>31</sup> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes. 

<sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them. 

<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
