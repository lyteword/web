# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Don’t boast about tomorrow; for you don’t know what a day may bring. 

<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips. 

<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both. 

<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before jealousy? 

<sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 

<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are faithful, although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. 

<sup>7</sup> A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. 

<sup>8</sup> As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his home. 

<sup>9</sup> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend. 

<sup>10</sup> Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster. A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother. 

<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can answer my tormentor. 

<sup>12</sup> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. 

<sup>13</sup> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman! 

<sup>14</sup> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him. 

<sup>15</sup> A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike: 

<sup>16</sup> restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in his right hand. 

<sup>17</sup> Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance. 

<sup>18</sup> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored. 

<sup>19</sup> Like water reflects a face, so a man’s heart reflects the man. 

<sup>20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man’s eyes are never satisfied. 

<sup>21</sup> The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined by his praise. 

<sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness will not be removed from him. 

<sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds, 

<sup>24</sup> for riches are not forever, nor does the crown endure to all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are gathered in. 

<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of a field. 

<sup>27</sup> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, for your family’s food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
