# Proverbs 27 

**¹** Don’t boast about tomorrow; for you don’t know what a day may bring.

**²** Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.

**³** A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.

**⁴** Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before jealousy?

**⁵** Better is open rebuke than hidden love.

**⁶** The wounds of a friend are faithful, although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.

**⁷** A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.

**⁸** As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his home.

**⁹** Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.

**¹⁰** Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster. A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.

**¹¹** Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can answer my tormentor.

**¹²** A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.

**¹³** Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman!

**¹⁴** He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him.

**¹⁵** A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike:

**¹⁶** restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in his right hand.

**¹⁷** Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.

**¹⁸** Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored.

**¹⁹** Like water reflects a face, so a man’s heart reflects the man.

**²⁰** Sheol[^478] and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.

**²¹** The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined by his praise.

**²²** Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.

**²³** Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds,

**²⁴** for riches are not forever, nor does the crown endure to all generations.

**²⁵** The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are gathered in.

**²⁶** The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of a field.

**²⁷** There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, for your family’s food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.

[^478]: 27:20 Sheol is the place of the dead.
