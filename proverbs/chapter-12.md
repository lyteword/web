# Chapter 12

**¹** Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.

**²** A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, but he will condemn a man of wicked plans.

**³** A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

**⁴** A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones.

**⁵** The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.

**⁶** The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them.

**⁷** The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house of the righteous shall stand.

**⁸** A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he who has a warped mind shall be despised.

**⁹** Better is he who is little known, and has a servant, than he who honors himself and lacks bread.

**¹⁰** A righteous man respects the life of his animal, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

**¹¹** He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who chases fantasies is void of understanding.

**¹²** The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, but the root of the righteous flourishes.

**¹³** An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, but the righteous shall come out of trouble.

**¹⁴** A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth. The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him.

**¹⁵** The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who is wise listens to counsel.

**¹⁶** A fool shows his annoyance the same day, but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.

**¹⁷** He who is truthful testifies honestly, but a false witness lies.

**¹⁸** There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise heals.

**¹⁹** Truth’s lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue is only momentary.

**²⁰** Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but joy comes to the promoters of peace.

**²¹** No mischief shall happen to the righteous, but the wicked shall be filled with evil.

**²²** Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, but those who do the truth are his delight.

**²³** A prudent man keeps his knowledge, but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.

**²⁴** The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, but laziness ends in slave labor.

**²⁵** Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a kind word makes it glad.

**²⁶** A righteous person is cautious in friendship, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.

**²⁷** The slothful man doesn’t roast his game, but the possessions of diligent men are prized.

**²⁸** In the way of righteousness is life; in its path there is no death.
