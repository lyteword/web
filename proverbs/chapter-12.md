# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid. 

<sup>2</sup> A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, but he will condemn a man of wicked plans. 

<sup>3</sup> A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. 

<sup>4</sup> A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones. 

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful. 

<sup>6</sup> The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them. 

<sup>7</sup> The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house of the righteous shall stand. 

<sup>8</sup> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he who has a warped mind shall be despised. 

<sup>9</sup> Better is he who is little known, and has a servant, than he who honors himself and lacks bread. 

<sup>10</sup> A righteous man respects the life of his animal, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 

<sup>11</sup> He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who chases fantasies is void of understanding. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, but the root of the righteous flourishes. 

<sup>13</sup> An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, but the righteous shall come out of trouble. 

<sup>14</sup> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth. The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him. 

<sup>15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who is wise listens to counsel. 

<sup>16</sup> A fool shows his annoyance the same day, but one who overlooks an insult is prudent. 

<sup>17</sup> He who is truthful testifies honestly, but a false witness lies. 

<sup>18</sup> There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise heals. 

<sup>19</sup> Truth’s lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue is only momentary. 

<sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but joy comes to the promoters of peace. 

<sup>21</sup> No mischief shall happen to the righteous, but the wicked shall be filled with evil. 

<sup>22</sup> Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, but those who do the truth are his delight. 

<sup>23</sup> A prudent man keeps his knowledge, but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness. 

<sup>24</sup> The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, but laziness ends in slave labor. 

<sup>25</sup> Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a kind word makes it glad. 

<sup>26</sup> A righteous person is cautious in friendship, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. 

<sup>27</sup> The slothful man doesn’t roast his game, but the possessions of diligent men are prized. 

<sup>28</sup> In the way of righteousness is life; in its path there is no death.
