# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. 

<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” Call understanding your relative, 

<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words. 

<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice. 

<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, 

<sup>8</sup> passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house, 

<sup>9</sup> in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness. 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent. 

<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant. Her feet don’t stay in her house. 

<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner. 

<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him: 

<sup>14</sup> “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. Today I have paid my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you. 

<sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. 

<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. Let’s solace ourselves with loving. 

<sup>19</sup> For my husband isn’t at home. He has gone on a long journey. 

<sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.” 

<sup>21</sup> With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. 

<sup>22</sup> He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose. 

<sup>23</sup> Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and doesn’t know that it will cost his life. 

<sup>24</sup> Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. Don’t go astray in her paths, 

<sup>26</sup> for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. 

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.
