# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses. He turns it wherever he desires. 

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. 

<sup>4</sup> A high look and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin. 

<sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty. 

<sup>6</sup> Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death. 

<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they refuse to do what is right. 

<sup>8</sup> The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than to share a house with a contentious woman. 

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. 

<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. 

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. 

<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>16</sup> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits. 

<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure will be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, the treacherous for the upright. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman. 

<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man swallows it up. 

<sup>21</sup> He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life, righteousness, and honor. 

<sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name— he works in the arrogance of pride. 

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. 

<sup>26</sup> There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous give and don’t withhold. 

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination— how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! 

<sup>28</sup> A false witness will perish. A man who listens speaks to eternity. 

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. 

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh. 

<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory is with Yahweh.
