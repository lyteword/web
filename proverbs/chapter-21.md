# Chapter 21

**¹** The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses. He turns it wherever he desires.

**²** Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the hearts.

**³** To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.

**⁴** A high look and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.

**⁵** The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.

**⁶** Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.

**⁷** The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they refuse to do what is right.

**⁸** The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.

**⁹** It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than to share a house with a contentious woman.

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.

**¹¹** When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.

**¹²** The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin.

**¹³** Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.

**¹⁴** A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.

**¹⁵** It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.

**¹⁶** The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.

**¹⁷** He who loves pleasure will be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.

**¹⁸** The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, the treacherous for the upright.

**¹⁹** It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman.

**²⁰** There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man swallows it up.

**²¹** He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life, righteousness, and honor.

**²²** A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence.

**²³** Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.

**²⁴** The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name— he works in the arrogance of pride.

**²⁵** The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.

**²⁶** There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous give and don’t withhold.

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination— how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!

**²⁸** A false witness will perish. A man who listens speaks to eternity.

**²⁹** A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.

**³⁰** There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh.

**³¹** The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory is with Yahweh.
