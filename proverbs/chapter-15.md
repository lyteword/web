# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. 

<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouths of fools gush out folly. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh’s eyes are everywhere, keeping watch on the evil and the good. 

<sup>4</sup> A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but deceit in it crushes the spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> A fool despises his father’s correction, but he who heeds reproof shows prudence. 

<sup>6</sup> In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income of the wicked brings trouble. 

<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so with the heart of fools. 

<sup>8</sup> The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 

<sup>9</sup> The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but he loves him who follows after righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way. Whoever hates reproof shall die. 

<sup>11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh— how much more then the hearts of the children of men! 

<sup>12</sup> A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved; he will not go to the wise. 

<sup>13</sup> A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but an aching heart breaks the spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly. 

<sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted are wretched, but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, than great treasure with trouble. 

<sup>17</sup> Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened calf with hatred. 

<sup>18</sup> A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one who is slow to anger appeases strife. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path of the upright is a highway. 

<sup>20</sup> A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother. 

<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, but a man of understanding keeps his way straight. 

<sup>22</sup> Where there is no counsel, plans fail; but in a multitude of counselors they are established. 

<sup>23</sup> Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth. How good is a word at the right time! 

<sup>24</sup> The path of life leads upward for the wise, to keep him from going downward to Sheol. 

<sup>25</sup> Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, but he will keep the widow’s borders intact. 

<sup>26</sup> Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing. 

<sup>27</sup> He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live. 

<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous weighs answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil. 

<sup>29</sup> Yahweh is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous. 

<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart. Good news gives health to the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home among the wise. 

<sup>32</sup> He who refuses correction despises his own soul, but he who listens to reproof gets understanding. 

<sup>33</sup> The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom. Before honor is humility.
