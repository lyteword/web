# Chapter 6

**¹** Working together, we entreat also that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.

**²** For he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you. In a day of salvation I helped you.”[^1223] Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.

**³** We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,

**⁴** but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,

**⁵** in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings,

**⁶** in pureness, in knowledge, in perseverance, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,

**⁷** in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

**⁸** by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true,

**⁹** as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold—we live, as punished and not killed,

**¹⁰** as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.

**¹¹** Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.

**¹²** You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.

**¹³** Now in return—I speak as to my children—you also open your hearts.

**¹⁴** Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?

**¹⁵** What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever?

**¹⁶** What agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.”[^1224]

**¹⁷** Therefore “‘Come out from among them, and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.[^1225]

**¹⁸** I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.”[^1226]
