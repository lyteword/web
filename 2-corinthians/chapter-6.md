# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Working together, we entreat also that you do not receive the grace of God in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> For he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you. In a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 

<sup>3</sup> We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed, 

<sup>4</sup> but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 

<sup>5</sup> in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, 

<sup>6</sup> in pureness, in knowledge, in perseverance, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, 

<sup>7</sup> in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 

<sup>8</sup> by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true, 

<sup>9</sup> as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold—we live, as punished and not killed, 

<sup>10</sup> as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. 

<sup>11</sup> Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged. 

<sup>12</sup> You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections. 

<sup>13</sup> Now in return—I speak as to my children—you also open your hearts. 

<sup>14</sup> Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 

<sup>15</sup> What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever? 

<sup>16</sup> What agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.” 

<sup>17</sup> Therefore “‘Come out from among them, and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you. 

<sup>18</sup> I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.”
