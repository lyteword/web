# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles, 

<sup>2</sup> if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you, 

<sup>3</sup> how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 

<sup>4</sup> by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, 

<sup>5</sup> which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit, 

<sup>6</sup> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News, 

<sup>7</sup> of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. 

<sup>8</sup> To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 

<sup>9</sup> and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ, 

<sup>10</sup> to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, 

<sup>11</sup> according to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> In him we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. 

<sup>13</sup> Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory. 

<sup>14</sup> For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 

<sup>16</sup> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person, 

<sup>17</sup> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 

<sup>18</sup> may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth, 

<sup>19</sup> and to know Christâ€™s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 

<sup>20</sup> Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 

<sup>21</sup> to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
