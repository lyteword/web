# Chapter 5

**¹** Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.

**²** Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.

**³** But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;

**⁴** nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate, but rather giving of thanks.

**⁵** Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man (who is an idolater), has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.

**⁶** Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.

**⁷** Therefore don’t be partakers with them.

**⁸** For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,

**⁹** for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,

**¹⁰** proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.

**¹¹** Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.

**¹²** For it is a shame even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.

**¹³** But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.

**¹⁴** Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”

**¹⁵** Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,

**¹⁶** redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

**¹⁷** Therefore, don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

**¹⁸** Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,

**¹⁹** speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

**²⁰** giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;

**²¹** subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.

**²²** Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

**²³** For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.

**²⁴** But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.

**²⁵** Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly and gave himself up for her,

**²⁶** that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,

**²⁷** that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without defect.

**²⁸** Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.

**²⁹** For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly,

**³⁰** because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.

**³¹** “For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh.”[^1256]

**³²** This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and the assembly.

**³³** Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
