# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ[^1249] Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,

<sup>4</sup> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without defect before him in love,

<sup>5</sup> having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,

<sup>6</sup> to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely gave us favor in the Beloved.

<sup>7</sup> In him we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace

<sup>8</sup> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,

<sup>9</sup> making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him

<sup>10</sup> to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in him.

<sup>11</sup> We were also assigned an inheritance in him, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who does all things after the counsel of his will,

<sup>12</sup> to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.

<sup>13</sup> In him you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,

<sup>14</sup> who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory.

<sup>15</sup> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and the love which you have toward all the saints,

<sup>16</sup> don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,

<sup>17</sup> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,

<sup>18</sup> having the eyes of your hearts[^1250] enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

<sup>19</sup> and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might

<sup>20</sup> which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,

<sup>21</sup> far above all rule, authority, power, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.

<sup>22</sup> He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,

<sup>23</sup> which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

[^1249]: 1:1 “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
[^1250]: 1:18 TR reads “understanding” instead of “hearts”
