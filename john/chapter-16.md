# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> “I have said these things to you so that you wouldn’t be caused to stumble. 

<sup>2</sup> They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. 

<sup>3</sup> They will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me. 

<sup>4</sup> But I have told you these things so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. 

<sup>5</sup> But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ 

<sup>6</sup> But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. 

<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. 

<sup>8</sup> When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; 

<sup>9</sup> about sin, because they don’t believe in me; 

<sup>10</sup> about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more; 

<sup>11</sup> about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. 

<sup>12</sup> “I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. 

<sup>13</sup> However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. 

<sup>14</sup> He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine and will declare it to you. 

<sup>15</sup> All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine and will declare it to you. 

<sup>16</sup> “A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.” 

<sup>17</sup> Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’ and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?” 

<sup>18</sup> They said therefore, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while’? We don’t know what he is saying.” 

<sup>19</sup> Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, “Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’? 

<sup>20</sup> Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 

<sup>21</sup> A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. 

<sup>22</sup> Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. 

<sup>23</sup> “In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. 

<sup>24</sup> Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. 

<sup>25</sup> “I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. 

<sup>26</sup> In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, 

<sup>27</sup> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. 

<sup>28</sup> I came from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.” 

<sup>29</sup> His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech. 

<sup>30</sup> Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.” 

<sup>31</sup> Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? 

<sup>32</sup> Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 

<sup>33</sup> I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”
