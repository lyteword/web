# Chapter 7

**¹** After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

**²** Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.

**³** His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.

**⁴** For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”

**⁵** For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.

**⁶** Jesus therefore said to them,  “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.

**⁷**  The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.

**⁸**  You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”

**⁹** Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.

**¹⁰** But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.

**¹¹** The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”

**¹²** There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”

**¹³** Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.

**¹⁴** But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

**¹⁵** The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”

**¹⁶** Jesus therefore answered them,  “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.

**¹⁷**  If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself.

**¹⁸**  He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

**¹⁹**  Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”

**²⁰** The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”

**²¹** Jesus answered them,  “I did one work and you all marvel because of it.

**²²**  Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.

**²³**  If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?

**²⁴**  Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”

**²⁵** Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?

**²⁶** Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?

**²⁷** However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”

**²⁸** Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,  “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.

**²⁹**  I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”

**³⁰** They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.

**³¹** But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”

**³²** The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.

**³³** Then Jesus said,  “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.

**³⁴**  You will seek me and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”

**³⁵** The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

**³⁶** What is this word that he said,  ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’ and  ‘Where I am, you can’t come’?”

**³⁷** Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out,  “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!

**³⁸**  He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”

**³⁹** But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.

**⁴⁰** Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”

**⁴¹** Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?

**⁴²** Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring[^965] of David,[^966] and from Bethlehem,[^967] the village where David was?”

**⁴³** So a division arose in the multitude because of him.

**⁴⁴** Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.

**⁴⁵** The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”

**⁴⁶** The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”

**⁴⁷** The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?

**⁴⁸** Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him?

**⁴⁹** But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.”

**⁵⁰** Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,

**⁵¹** “Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”

**⁵²** They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”[^968]

**⁵³** Everyone went to his own house,
