# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 

<sup>2</sup> Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. 

<sup>3</sup> His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. 

<sup>4</sup> For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.” 

<sup>5</sup> For even his brothers didn’t believe in him. 

<sup>6</sup> Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. 

<sup>7</sup> The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. 

<sup>8</sup> You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.” 

<sup>9</sup> Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. 

<sup>10</sup> But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 

<sup>11</sup> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” 

<sup>12</sup> There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” 

<sup>13</sup> Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. 

<sup>14</sup> But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 

<sup>15</sup> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?” 

<sup>16</sup> Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 

<sup>17</sup> If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself. 

<sup>18</sup> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 

<sup>19</sup> Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?” 

<sup>20</sup> The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?” 

<sup>21</sup> Jesus answered them, “I did one work and you all marvel because of it. 

<sup>22</sup> Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. 

<sup>23</sup> If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? 

<sup>24</sup> Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” 

<sup>25</sup> Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? 

<sup>26</sup> Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? 

<sup>27</sup> However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.” 

<sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. 

<sup>29</sup> I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.” 

<sup>30</sup> They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 

<sup>31</sup> But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?” 

<sup>32</sup> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 

<sup>33</sup> Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. 

<sup>34</sup> You will seek me and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.” 

<sup>35</sup> The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? 

<sup>36</sup> What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’ and ‘Where I am, you can’t come’?” 

<sup>37</sup> Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! 

<sup>38</sup> He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.” 

<sup>39</sup> But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. 

<sup>40</sup> Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.” 

<sup>41</sup> Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? 

<sup>42</sup> Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 

<sup>43</sup> So a division arose in the multitude because of him. 

<sup>44</sup> Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. 

<sup>45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?” 

<sup>46</sup> The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!” 

<sup>47</sup> The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? 

<sup>48</sup> Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him? 

<sup>49</sup> But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.” 

<sup>50</sup> Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them, 

<sup>51</sup> “Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?” 

<sup>52</sup> They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.” 

<sup>53</sup> Everyone went to his own house,
