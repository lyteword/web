# John 9 

**¹** As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.

**²** His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

**³** Jesus answered,  “This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.

**⁴**  I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.

**⁵**  While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”

**⁶** When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,

**⁷** and said to him,  “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.

**⁸** Therefore the neighbors and those who saw that he was blind before said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”

**⁹** Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” He said, “I am he.”

**¹⁰** They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”

**¹¹** He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me,  ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”

**¹²** Then they asked him, “Where is he?” He said, “I don’t know.”

**¹³** They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.

**¹⁴** It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.

**¹⁵** Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”

**¹⁶** Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” So there was division among them.

**¹⁷** Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”

**¹⁸** The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,

**¹⁹** and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”

**²⁰** His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;

**²¹** but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”

**²²** His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.

**²³** Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”

**²⁴** So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”

**²⁵** He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”

**²⁶** They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”

**²⁷** He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”

**²⁸** They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.

**²⁹** We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”

**³⁰** The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.

**³¹** We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.[^976]

**³²** Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.

**³³** If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”

**³⁴** They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out.

**³⁵** Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said,  “Do you believe in the Son of God?”

**³⁶** He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”

**³⁷** Jesus said to him,  “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”

**³⁸** He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.

**³⁹** Jesus said,  “I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”

**⁴⁰** Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”

**⁴¹** Jesus said to them,  “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.
