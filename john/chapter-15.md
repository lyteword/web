# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> “I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer. 

<sup>2</sup> Every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 

<sup>3</sup> You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 

<sup>4</sup> Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. 

<sup>5</sup> I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 

<sup>6</sup> If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 

<sup>7</sup> If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. 

<sup>8</sup> “In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples. 

<sup>9</sup> Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. 

<sup>10</sup> If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. 

<sup>11</sup> I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. 

<sup>12</sup> “This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you. 

<sup>13</sup> Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. 

<sup>14</sup> You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. 

<sup>15</sup> No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. 

<sup>16</sup> You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. 

<sup>17</sup> “I command these things to you, that you may love one another. 

<sup>18</sup> If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. 

<sup>19</sup> If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 

<sup>20</sup> Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. 

<sup>21</sup> But they will do all these things to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me. 

<sup>22</sup> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 

<sup>23</sup> He who hates me, hates my Father also. 

<sup>24</sup> If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father. 

<sup>25</sup> But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’ 

<sup>26</sup> “When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me. 

<sup>27</sup> You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
