# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.

<sup>2</sup> Then I asked, “Where are you going?” He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”

<sup>3</sup> Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,

<sup>4</sup> and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.

<sup>5</sup> For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her.

<sup>6</sup> Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.

<sup>7</sup> ‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’

<sup>8</sup> For Yahweh of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.

<sup>9</sup> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.

<sup>10</sup> Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! For behold, I come and I will dwell within you,’ says Yahweh.

<sup>11</sup> Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.

<sup>12</sup> Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”
