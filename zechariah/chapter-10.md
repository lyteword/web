# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time, Yahweh who makes storm clouds, and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field. 

<sup>2</sup> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams. They comfort in vain. Therefore they go their way like sheep. They are oppressed, because there is no shepherd. 

<sup>3</sup> My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the male goats, for Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle. 

<sup>4</sup> From him will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together. 

<sup>5</sup> They will be as mighty men, treading down muddy streets in the battle. They will fight, because Yahweh is with them. The riders on horses will be confounded. 

<sup>6</sup> “I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back, for I have mercy on them. They will be as though I had not cast them off, for I am Yahweh their God, and I will hear them. 

<sup>7</sup> Ephraim will be like a mighty man, and their heart will rejoice as through wine. Yes, their children will see it and rejoice. Their heart will be glad in Yahweh. 

<sup>8</sup> I will signal for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them. They will increase as they were before. 

<sup>9</sup> I will sow them among the peoples. They will remember me in far countries. They will live with their children and will return. 

<sup>10</sup> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria. I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and there won’t be room enough for them. 

<sup>11</sup> He will pass through the sea of affliction, and will strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile will dry up; and the pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will depart. 

<sup>12</sup> I will strengthen them in Yahweh. They will walk up and down in his name,” says Yahweh.
