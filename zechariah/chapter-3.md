# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?” 

<sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. 

<sup>4</sup> He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.” 

<sup>5</sup> I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel was standing by. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh’s angel solemnly assured Joshua, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> “Yahweh of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by. 

<sup>8</sup> Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign; for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch. 

<sup>9</sup> For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua: on one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave its inscription,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 

<sup>10</sup> In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’”
