# Chapter 11

**¹** Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,

**²** “Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?

**³** Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, will no man make you ashamed?

**⁴** For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’

**⁵** But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you,

**⁶** that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.

**⁷** “Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?

**⁸** They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol.[^406] What can you know?

**⁹** Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

**¹⁰** If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?

**¹¹** For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it.

**¹²** An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.

**¹³** “If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him.

**¹⁴** If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.

**¹⁵** Surely then you will lift up your face without spot. Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear,

**¹⁶** for you will forget your misery. You will remember it like waters that have passed away.

**¹⁷** Life will be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning.

**¹⁸** You will be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety.

**¹⁹** Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid. Yes, many will court your favor.

**²⁰** But the eyes of the wicked will fail. They will have no way to flee. Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit.”

[^406]: 11:8 Sheol is the place of the dead.
