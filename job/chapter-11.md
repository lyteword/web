# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified? 

<sup>3</sup> Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, will no man make you ashamed? 

<sup>4</sup> For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’ 

<sup>5</sup> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you, 

<sup>6</sup> that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves. 

<sup>7</sup> “Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty? 

<sup>8</sup> They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know? 

<sup>9</sup> Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him? 

<sup>11</sup> For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it. 

<sup>12</sup> An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt. 

<sup>13</sup> “If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him. 

<sup>14</sup> If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents. 

<sup>15</sup> Surely then you will lift up your face without spot. Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear, 

<sup>16</sup> for you will forget your misery. You will remember it like waters that have passed away. 

<sup>17</sup> Life will be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> You will be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety. 

<sup>19</sup> Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid. Yes, many will court your favor. 

<sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked will fail. They will have no way to flee. Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit.”
