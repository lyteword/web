# Chapter 27

**¹** Job again took up his parable, and said,

**²** “As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter

**³** (for the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);

**⁴** surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness, neither will my tongue utter deceit.

**⁵** Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.

**⁶** I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart will not reproach me so long as I live.

**⁷** “Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.

**⁸** For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?

**⁹** Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?

**¹⁰** Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times?

**¹¹** I will teach you about the hand of God. I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty.

**¹²** Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?

**¹³** “This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.

**¹⁴** If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring will not be satisfied with bread.

**¹⁵** Those who remain of him will be buried in death. His widows will make no lamentation.

**¹⁶** Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay;

**¹⁷** he may prepare it, but the just will put it on, and the innocent will divide the silver.

**¹⁸** He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes.

**¹⁹** He lies down rich, but he will not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not.

**²⁰** Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night.

**²¹** The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place.

**²²** For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand.

**²³** Men will clap their hands at him, and will hiss him out of his place.
