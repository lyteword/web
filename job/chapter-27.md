# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Job again took up his parable, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> “As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter 

<sup>3</sup> (for the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils); 

<sup>4</sup> surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness, neither will my tongue utter deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 

<sup>6</sup> I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart will not reproach me so long as I live. 

<sup>7</sup> “Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 

<sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life? 

<sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him? 

<sup>10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times? 

<sup>11</sup> I will teach you about the hand of God. I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 

<sup>13</sup> “This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty. 

<sup>14</sup> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring will not be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>15</sup> Those who remain of him will be buried in death. His widows will make no lamentation. 

<sup>16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay; 

<sup>17</sup> he may prepare it, but the just will put it on, and the innocent will divide the silver. 

<sup>18</sup> He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes. 

<sup>19</sup> He lies down rich, but he will not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not. 

<sup>20</sup> Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night. 

<sup>21</sup> The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand. 

<sup>23</sup> Men will clap their hands at him, and will hiss him out of his place.
