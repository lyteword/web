# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God? 

<sup>3</sup> If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand. 

<sup>4</sup> God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him and prospered? 

<sup>5</sup> He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger. 

<sup>6</sup> He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble. 

<sup>7</sup> He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars. 

<sup>8</sup> He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea. 

<sup>9</sup> He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south. 

<sup>10</sup> He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’ 

<sup>13</sup> “God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him. 

<sup>14</sup> How much less will I answer him, and choose my words to argue with him? 

<sup>15</sup> Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge. 

<sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 

<sup>19</sup> If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’ 

<sup>20</sup> Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me. Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse. 

<sup>21</sup> I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life. 

<sup>22</sup> “It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked. 

<sup>23</sup> If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent. 

<sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it? 

<sup>25</sup> “Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good. 

<sup>26</sup> They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey. 

<sup>27</sup> If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up,’ 

<sup>28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows. I know that you will not hold me innocent. 

<sup>29</sup> I will be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain? 

<sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye, 

<sup>31</sup> yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes will abhor me. 

<sup>32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment. 

<sup>33</sup> There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both. 

<sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid; 

<sup>35</sup> then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.
