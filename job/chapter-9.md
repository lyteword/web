# Job 9 

**¹** Then Job answered,

**²** “Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?

**³** If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.

**⁴** God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?

**⁵** He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger.

**⁶** He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble.

**⁷** He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars.

**⁸** He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.

**⁹** He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south.

**¹⁰** He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number.

**¹¹** Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.

**¹²** Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’

**¹³** “God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.

**¹⁴** How much less will I answer him, and choose my words to argue with him?

**¹⁵** Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge.

**¹⁶** If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.

**¹⁷** For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause.

**¹⁸** He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.

**¹⁹** If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’

**²⁰** Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me. Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.

**²¹** I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life.

**²²** “It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.

**²³** If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent.

**²⁴** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it?

**²⁵** “Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good.

**²⁶** They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey.

**²⁷** If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up,’

**²⁸** I am afraid of all my sorrows. I know that you will not hold me innocent.

**²⁹** I will be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?

**³⁰** If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,

**³¹** yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes will abhor me.

**³²** For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.

**³³** There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both.

**³⁴** Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid;

**³⁵** then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.
