# Job 13 

**¹** “Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it.

**²** What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you.

**³** “Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God.

**⁴** But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value.

**⁵** Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise.

**⁶** Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips.

**⁷** Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?

**⁸** Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?

**⁹** Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?

**¹⁰** He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.

**¹¹** Won’t his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall on you?

**¹²** Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay.

**¹³** “Be silent! Leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will.

**¹⁴** Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?

**¹⁵** Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.

**¹⁶** This also will be my salvation, that a godless man will not come before him.

**¹⁷** Listen carefully to my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears.

**¹⁸** See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous.

**¹⁹** Who is he who will contend with me? For then I would hold my peace and give up the spirit.

**²⁰** “Only don’t do two things to me, then I will not hide myself from your face:

**²¹** withdraw your hand far from me, and don’t let your terror make me afraid.

**²²** Then call, and I will answer, or let me speak, and you answer me.

**²³** How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin.

**²⁴** Why do you hide your face, and consider me your enemy?

**²⁵** Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble?

**²⁶** For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.

**²⁷** You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet,

**²⁸** though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
