# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> “Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it. 

<sup>2</sup> What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you. 

<sup>3</sup> “Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God. 

<sup>4</sup> But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? 

<sup>8</sup> Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God? 

<sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him? 

<sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality. 

<sup>11</sup> Won’t his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall on you? 

<sup>12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay. 

<sup>13</sup> “Be silent! Leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will. 

<sup>14</sup> Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand? 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him. 

<sup>16</sup> This also will be my salvation, that a godless man will not come before him. 

<sup>17</sup> Listen carefully to my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears. 

<sup>18</sup> See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous. 

<sup>19</sup> Who is he who will contend with me? For then I would hold my peace and give up the spirit. 

<sup>20</sup> “Only don’t do two things to me, then I will not hide myself from your face: 

<sup>21</sup> withdraw your hand far from me, and don’t let your terror make me afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> Then call, and I will answer, or let me speak, and you answer me. 

<sup>23</sup> How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin. 

<sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face, and consider me your enemy? 

<sup>25</sup> Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble? 

<sup>26</sup> For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 

<sup>27</sup> You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet, 

<sup>28</sup> though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
