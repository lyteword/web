# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> “Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?

<sup>2</sup> As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,

<sup>3</sup> so I am made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me.

<sup>4</sup> When I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.

<sup>5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.

<sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.

<sup>7</sup> Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye will no more see good.

<sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me will see me no more. Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.

<sup>9</sup> As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol[^405] will come up no more.

<sup>10</sup> He will return no more to his house, neither will his place know him any more.

<sup>11</sup> “Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

<sup>12</sup> Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?

<sup>13</sup> When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me. My couch will ease my complaint,’

<sup>14</sup> then you scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions,

<sup>15</sup> so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.

<sup>16</sup> I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.

<sup>17</sup> What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him,

<sup>18</sup> that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?

<sup>19</sup> How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?

<sup>20</sup> If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself?

<sup>21</sup> Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now will I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I will not be.”

[^405]: 7:9 Sheol is the place of the dead.
