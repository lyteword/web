# Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food. 

<sup>4</sup> Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, God has taken away my right. 

<sup>6</sup> Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’ 

<sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water, 

<sup>8</sup> who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men? 

<sup>9</sup> For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.’ 

<sup>10</sup> “Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> For the work of a man he will give to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 

<sup>12</sup> Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 

<sup>13</sup> Who put him in charge of the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world? 

<sup>14</sup> If he set his heart on himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, 

<sup>15</sup> all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 

<sup>16</sup> “If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words. 

<sup>17</sup> Should even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty, 

<sup>18</sup> who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’? 

<sup>19</sup> He doesn’t respect the persons of princes, nor respect the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of his hands. 

<sup>20</sup> In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand. 

<sup>21</sup> “For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings. 

<sup>22</sup> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

<sup>23</sup> For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. 

<sup>24</sup> He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place. 

<sup>25</sup> Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 

<sup>26</sup> He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 

<sup>27</sup> because they turned away from following him, and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways, 

<sup>28</sup> so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>29</sup> When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? He is over a nation or a man alike, 

<sup>30</sup> that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 

<sup>31</sup> “For has any said to God, ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more. 

<sup>32</sup> Teach me that which I don’t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’? 

<sup>33</sup> Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know. 

<sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me: 

<sup>35</sup> ‘Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.’ 

<sup>36</sup> I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men. 

<sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.”
