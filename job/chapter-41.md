# Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> “Can you draw out Leviathan[^417] with a fish hook, or press down his tongue with a cord?

<sup>2</sup> Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook?

<sup>3</sup> Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you?

<sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?

<sup>5</sup> Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls?

<sup>6</sup> Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants?

<sup>7</sup> Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?

<sup>8</sup> Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.

<sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?

<sup>10</sup> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?

<sup>11</sup> Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine.

<sup>12</sup> “I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.

<sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come within his jaws?

<sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.

<sup>15</sup> Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal.

<sup>16</sup> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

<sup>17</sup> They are joined to one another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.

<sup>18</sup> His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

<sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap out.

<sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.

<sup>21</sup> His breath kindles coals. A flame goes out of his mouth.

<sup>22</sup> There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him.

<sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.

<sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone.

<sup>25</sup> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing.

<sup>26</sup> If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

<sup>27</sup> He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.

<sup>28</sup> The arrow can’t make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him.

<sup>29</sup> Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.

<sup>30</sup> His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.

<sup>31</sup> He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

<sup>32</sup> He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair.

<sup>33</sup> On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.

<sup>34</sup> He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.”

[^417]: 41:1 Leviathan is a name for a crocodile or similar creature.
