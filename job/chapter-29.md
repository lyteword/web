# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> Job again took up his parable, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> “Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me; 

<sup>3</sup> when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I walked through darkness, 

<sup>4</sup> as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was in my tent, 

<sup>5</sup> when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me, 

<sup>6</sup> when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me, 

<sup>7</sup> when I went out to the city gate, when I prepared my seat in the street. 

<sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves. The aged rose up and stood. 

<sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 

<sup>10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. 

<sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it commended me, 

<sup>12</sup> because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him, 

<sup>13</sup> the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 

<sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem. 

<sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. 

<sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy. I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know. 

<sup>17</sup> I broke the jaws of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth. 

<sup>18</sup> Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house, I will count my days as the sand. 

<sup>19</sup> My root is spread out to the waters. The dew lies all night on my branch. 

<sup>20</sup> My glory is fresh in me. My bow is renewed in my hand.’ 

<sup>21</sup> “Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel. 

<sup>22</sup> After my words they didn’t speak again. My speech fell on them. 

<sup>23</sup> They waited for me as for the rain. Their mouths drank as with the spring rain. 

<sup>24</sup> I smiled on them when they had no confidence. They didn’t reject the light of my face. 

<sup>25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat as chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.
