# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 

<sup>3</sup> Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands. 

<sup>4</sup> Your words have supported him who was falling, you have made the feeble knees firm. 

<sup>5</sup> But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled. 

<sup>6</sup> Isn’t your piety your confidence? Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope? 

<sup>7</sup> “Remember, now, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble, reap the same. 

<sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed. 

<sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 

<sup>12</sup> “Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it. 

<sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 

<sup>14</sup> fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 

<sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up. 

<sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 

<sup>17</sup> ‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 

<sup>18</sup> Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error. 

<sup>19</sup> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth! 

<sup>20</sup> Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it. 

<sup>21</sup> Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’
