# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Do you think this to be your right, or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’ 

<sup>3</sup> that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’ 

<sup>4</sup> I will answer you, and your companions with you. 

<sup>5</sup> Look to the skies, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you. 

<sup>6</sup> If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 

<sup>7</sup> If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive from your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man. 

<sup>9</sup> “By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 

<sup>10</sup> But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 

<sup>11</sup> who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’ 

<sup>12</sup> There they cry, but no one answers, because of the pride of evil men. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

<sup>14</sup> How much less when you say you don’t see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him! 

<sup>15</sup> But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance, 

<sup>16</sup> therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.”
