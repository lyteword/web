# Chapter 12

**¹** Then Job answered,

**²** “No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom will die with you.

**³** But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?

**⁴** I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke.

**⁵** In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.

**⁶** The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their god in their hands.

**⁷** “But ask the animals now, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.

**⁸** Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you. The fish of the sea will declare to you.

**⁹** Who doesn’t know that in all these, Yahweh’s hand has done this,

**¹⁰** in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?

**¹¹** Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?

**¹²** With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.

**¹³** “With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.

**¹⁴** Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.

**¹⁵** Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.

**¹⁶** With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his.

**¹⁷** He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.

**¹⁸** He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt.

**¹⁹** He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.

**²⁰** He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders.

**²¹** He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.

**²²** He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.

**²³** He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.

**²⁴** He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

**²⁵** They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
