# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom will die with you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these? 

<sup>4</sup> I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke. 

<sup>5</sup> In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips. 

<sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their god in their hands. 

<sup>7</sup> “But ask the animals now, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, and they will tell you. 

<sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you. The fish of the sea will declare to you. 

<sup>9</sup> Who doesn’t know that in all these, Yahweh’s hand has done this, 

<sup>10</sup> in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind? 

<sup>11</sup> Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food? 

<sup>12</sup> With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding. 

<sup>13</sup> “With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his. 

<sup>17</sup> He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools. 

<sup>18</sup> He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt. 

<sup>19</sup> He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty. 

<sup>20</sup> He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders. 

<sup>21</sup> He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong. 

<sup>22</sup> He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death. 

<sup>23</sup> He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive. 

<sup>24</sup> He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. 

<sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
