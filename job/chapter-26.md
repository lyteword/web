# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “How have you helped him who is without power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength! 

<sup>3</sup> How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 

<sup>4</sup> To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit came out of you? 

<sup>5</sup> “The departed spirits tremble, those beneath the waters and all that live in them. 

<sup>6</sup> Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 

<sup>7</sup> He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth on nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them. 

<sup>9</sup> He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it. 

<sup>10</sup> He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness. 

<sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke. 

<sup>12</sup> He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab. 

<sup>13</sup> By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?”
