# Job 26 

**¹** Then Job answered,

**²** “How have you helped him who is without power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength!

**³** How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!

**⁴** To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit came out of you?

**⁵** “The departed spirits tremble, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.

**⁶** Sheol[^412] is naked before God, and Abaddon[^413] has no covering.

**⁷** He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth on nothing.

**⁸** He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them.

**⁹** He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.

**¹⁰** He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness.

**¹¹** The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.

**¹²** He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.

**¹³** By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.

**¹⁴** Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?”

[^412]: 26:6 Sheol is the place of the dead.
[^413]: 26:6 Abaddon means Destroyer.
