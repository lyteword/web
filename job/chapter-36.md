# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> Elihu also continued, and said,

<sup>2</sup> “Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.

<sup>3</sup> I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

<sup>5</sup> “Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding.

<sup>6</sup> He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted.

<sup>7</sup> He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted.

<sup>8</sup> If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions,

<sup>9</sup> then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.

<sup>10</sup> He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.

<sup>11</sup> If they listen and serve him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

<sup>12</sup> But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword; they will die without knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> “But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don’t cry for help when he binds them.

<sup>14</sup> They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean.

<sup>15</sup> He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression.

<sup>16</sup> Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a wide place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.

<sup>17</sup> “But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you.

<sup>18</sup> Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.

<sup>19</sup> Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength?

<sup>20</sup> Don’t desire the night, when people are cut off in their place.

<sup>21</sup> Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction.

<sup>22</sup> Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?

<sup>23</sup> Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’?

<sup>24</sup> “Remember that you magnify his work, about which men have sung.

<sup>25</sup> All men have looked on it. Man sees it afar off.

<sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. The number of his years is unsearchable.

<sup>27</sup> For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor,

<sup>28</sup> which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.

<sup>29</sup> Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunderings of his pavilion?

<sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea.

<sup>31</sup> For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance.

<sup>32</sup> He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.

<sup>33</sup> Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also, concerning the storm that comes up.
