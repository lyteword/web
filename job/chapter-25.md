# Job 25 

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

**²** “Dominion and fear are with him. He makes peace in his high places.

**³** Can his armies be counted? On whom does his light not arise?

**⁴** How then can man be just with God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?

**⁵** Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight;

**⁶** How much less man, who is a worm, and the son of man, who is a worm!”
