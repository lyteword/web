# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Dominion and fear are with him. He makes peace in his high places. 

<sup>3</sup> Can his armies be counted? On whom does his light not arise? 

<sup>4</sup> How then can man be just with God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean? 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight; 

<sup>6</sup> How much less man, who is a worm, and the son of man, who is a worm!”
