# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> “Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine.

<sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out of the ore.

<sup>3</sup> Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound, the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.

<sup>4</sup> He breaks open a shaft away from where people live. They are forgotten by the foot. They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.

<sup>5</sup> As for the earth, out of it comes bread. Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.

<sup>6</sup> Sapphires come from its rocks. It has dust of gold.

<sup>7</sup> That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.

<sup>8</sup> The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed by there.

<sup>9</sup> He puts his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns the mountains by the roots.

<sup>10</sup> He cuts out channels among the rocks. His eye sees every precious thing.

<sup>11</sup> He binds the streams that they don’t trickle. The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.

<sup>12</sup> “But where will wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding?

<sup>13</sup> Man doesn’t know its price, and it isn’t found in the land of the living.

<sup>14</sup> The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’ The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’

<sup>15</sup> It can’t be gotten for gold, neither will silver be weighed for its price.

<sup>16</sup> It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.[^414]

<sup>17</sup> Gold and glass can’t equal it, neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.

<sup>18</sup> No mention will be made of coral or of crystal. Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.

<sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it. It won’t be valued with pure gold.

<sup>20</sup> Where then does wisdom come from? Where is the place of understanding?

<sup>21</sup> Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky.

<sup>22</sup> Destruction and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’

<sup>23</sup> “God understands its way, and he knows its place.

<sup>24</sup> For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole sky.

<sup>25</sup> He establishes the force of the wind. Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.

<sup>26</sup> When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder,

<sup>27</sup> then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yes, and searched it out.

<sup>28</sup> To man he said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord,[^415] that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.’”
