# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. 

<sup>2</sup> Job answered: 

<sup>3</sup> “Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’ 

<sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it. 

<sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes the day black terrify it. 

<sup>6</sup> As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan. 

<sup>9</sup> Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, 

<sup>10</sup> because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> “Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me? 

<sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse? 

<sup>13</sup> For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, 

<sup>14</sup> with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves; 

<sup>15</sup> or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver; 

<sup>16</sup> or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light. 

<sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest. 

<sup>18</sup> There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster. 

<sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> “Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul, 

<sup>21</sup> who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 

<sup>22</sup> who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water. 

<sup>25</sup> For the thing which I fear comes on me, that which I am afraid of comes to me. 

<sup>26</sup> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest; but trouble comes.”
