# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> “Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns? 

<sup>2</sup> Can you count the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth? 

<sup>3</sup> They bow themselves. They bear their young. They end their labor pains. 

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go out, and don’t return again. 

<sup>5</sup> “Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey, 

<sup>6</sup> whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place? 

<sup>7</sup> He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver. 

<sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture. He searches after every green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> “Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough? 

<sup>10</sup> Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you? 

<sup>11</sup> Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor? 

<sup>12</sup> Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor? 

<sup>13</sup> “The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the feathers and plumage of love? 

<sup>14</sup> For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust, 

<sup>15</sup> and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them. 

<sup>16</sup> She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear, 

<sup>17</sup> because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider. 

<sup>19</sup> “Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane? 

<sup>20</sup> Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome. 

<sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men. 

<sup>22</sup> He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin. 

<sup>24</sup> He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet. 

<sup>25</sup> As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

<sup>26</sup> “Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south? 

<sup>27</sup> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high? 

<sup>28</sup> On the cliff he dwells and makes his home, on the point of the cliff and the stronghold. 

<sup>29</sup> From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off. 

<sup>30</sup> His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is.”
