# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

<sup>2</sup> “Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?

<sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?

<sup>4</sup> Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.

<sup>5</sup> For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.

<sup>6</sup> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you.

<sup>7</sup> “Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills?

<sup>8</sup> Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?

<sup>9</sup> What do you know that we don’t know? What do you understand which is not in us?

<sup>10</sup> With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than your father.

<sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?

<sup>12</sup> Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,

<sup>13</sup> that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?

<sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;

<sup>16</sup> how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!

<sup>17</sup> “I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare

<sup>18</sup> (which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;

<sup>19</sup> to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):

<sup>20</sup> the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

<sup>21</sup> A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.

<sup>22</sup> He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.

<sup>23</sup> He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

<sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

<sup>25</sup> Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,

<sup>26</sup> he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers,

<sup>27</sup> because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.

<sup>28</sup> He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.

<sup>29</sup> He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.

<sup>30</sup> He will not depart out of darkness. The flame will dry up his branches. He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.

<sup>31</sup> Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his reward.

<sup>32</sup> It will be accomplished before his time. His branch will not be green.

<sup>33</sup> He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.

<sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

<sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief and produce iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”
