# Chapter 15

**¹** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

**²** “Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?

**³** Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?

**⁴** Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.

**⁵** For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.

**⁶** Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you.

**⁷** “Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills?

**⁸** Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?

**⁹** What do you know that we don’t know? What do you understand which is not in us?

**¹⁰** With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than your father.

**¹¹** Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?

**¹²** Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,

**¹³** that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?

**¹⁴** What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

**¹⁵** Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;

**¹⁶** how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!

**¹⁷** “I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare

**¹⁸** (which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;

**¹⁹** to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):

**²⁰** the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

**²¹** A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.

**²²** He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.

**²³** He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

**²⁴** Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

**²⁵** Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,

**²⁶** he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers,

**²⁷** because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.

**²⁸** He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.

**²⁹** He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.

**³⁰** He will not depart out of darkness. The flame will dry up his branches. He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.

**³¹** Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his reward.

**³²** It will be accomplished before his time. His branch will not be green.

**³³** He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.

**³⁴** For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

**³⁵** They conceive mischief and produce iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”
