# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> “My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct and the grave is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation. 

<sup>3</sup> “Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me? 

<sup>4</sup> For you have hidden their heart from understanding, therefore you will not exalt them. 

<sup>5</sup> He who denounces his friends for plunder, even the eyes of his children will fail. 

<sup>6</sup> “But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face. 

<sup>7</sup> My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow. 

<sup>8</sup> Upright men will be astonished at this. The innocent will stir himself up against the godless. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet the righteous will hold to his way. He who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> But as for you all, come back. I will not find a wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are past. My plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness, 

<sup>14</sup> if I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘My sister,’ 

<sup>15</sup> where then is my hope? As for my hope, who will see it? 

<sup>16</sup> Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”
