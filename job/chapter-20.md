# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Therefore my thoughts answer me, even by reason of my haste that is in me. 

<sup>3</sup> I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me. 

<sup>4</sup> Don’t you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth, 

<sup>5</sup> that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment? 

<sup>6</sup> Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, 

<sup>7</sup> yet he will perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ 

<sup>8</sup> He will fly away as a dream, and will not be found. Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 

<sup>9</sup> The eye which saw him will see him no more, neither will his place see him any more. 

<sup>10</sup> His children will seek the favor of the poor. His hands will give back his wealth. 

<sup>11</sup> His bones are full of his youth, but youth will lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> “Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, 

<sup>13</sup> though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth, 

<sup>14</sup> yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him. 

<sup>15</sup> He has swallowed down riches, and he will vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly. 

<sup>16</sup> He will suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue will kill him. 

<sup>17</sup> He will not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter. 

<sup>18</sup> He will restore that for which he labored, and will not swallow it down. He will not rejoice according to the substance that he has gotten. 

<sup>19</sup> For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he will not build it up. 

<sup>20</sup> “Because he knew no quietness within him, he will not save anything of that in which he delights. 

<sup>21</sup> There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity will not endure. 

<sup>22</sup> In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress will overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery will come on him. 

<sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating. 

<sup>24</sup> He will flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow will strike him through. 

<sup>25</sup> He draws it out, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him. 

<sup>26</sup> All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire will devour him. It will consume that which is left in his tent. 

<sup>27</sup> The heavens will reveal his iniquity. The earth will rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> The increase of his house will depart. They will rush away in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”
