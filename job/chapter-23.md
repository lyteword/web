# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Even today my complaint is rebellious. His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning. 

<sup>3</sup> Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat! 

<sup>4</sup> I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 

<sup>5</sup> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would tell me. 

<sup>6</sup> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No, but he would listen to me. 

<sup>7</sup> There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered forever from my judge. 

<sup>8</sup> “If I go east, he is not there. If I go west, I can’t find him. 

<sup>9</sup> He works to the north, but I can’t see him. He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him. 

<sup>10</sup> But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I will come out like gold. 

<sup>11</sup> My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned away. 

<sup>12</sup> I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 

<sup>13</sup> But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? What his soul desires, even that he does. 

<sup>14</sup> For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him. 

<sup>16</sup> For God has made my heart faint. The Almighty has terrified me. 

<sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
