# Chapter 23

**¹** Then Job answered,

**²** “Even today my complaint is rebellious. His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.

**³** Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!

**⁴** I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

**⁵** I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would tell me.

**⁶** Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No, but he would listen to me.

**⁷** There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered forever from my judge.

**⁸** “If I go east, he is not there. If I go west, I can’t find him.

**⁹** He works to the north, but I can’t see him. He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.

**¹⁰** But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I will come out like gold.

**¹¹** My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned away.

**¹²** I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

**¹³** But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? What his soul desires, even that he does.

**¹⁴** For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him.

**¹⁵** Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him.

**¹⁶** For God has made my heart faint. The Almighty has terrified me.

**¹⁷** Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
