# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself. 

<sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect? 

<sup>4</sup> Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment? 

<sup>5</sup> Isn’t your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities. 

<sup>6</sup> For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> You haven’t given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 

<sup>8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it. 

<sup>9</sup> You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you, 

<sup>11</sup> or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you. 

<sup>12</sup> “Isn’t God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are! 

<sup>13</sup> You say, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? 

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see. He walks on the vault of the sky.’ 

<sup>15</sup> Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden, 

<sup>16</sup> who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream, 

<sup>17</sup> who said to God, ‘Depart from us!’ and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’ 

<sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad. The innocent ridicule them, 

<sup>20</sup> saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off. The fire has consumed their remnant.’ 

<sup>21</sup> “Acquaint yourself with him now, and be at peace. By it, good will come to you. 

<sup>22</sup> Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart. 

<sup>23</sup> If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents. 

<sup>24</sup> Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks. 

<sup>25</sup> The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you. 

<sup>26</sup> For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and will lift up your face to God. 

<sup>27</sup> You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You will pay your vows. 

<sup>28</sup> You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you. Light will shine on your ways. 

<sup>29</sup> When they cast down, you will say, ‘be lifted up.’ He will save the humble person. 

<sup>30</sup> He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
