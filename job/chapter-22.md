# Job 22 

**¹** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,

**²** “Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.

**³** Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect?

**⁴** Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment?

**⁵** Isn’t your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.

**⁶** For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

**⁷** You haven’t given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

**⁸** But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it.

**⁹** You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.

**¹⁰** Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you,

**¹¹** or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you.

**¹²** “Isn’t God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are!

**¹³** You say, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?

**¹⁴** Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see. He walks on the vault of the sky.’

**¹⁵** Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden,

**¹⁶** who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,

**¹⁷** who said to God, ‘Depart from us!’ and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’

**¹⁸** Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

**¹⁹** The righteous see it, and are glad. The innocent ridicule them,

**²⁰** saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off. The fire has consumed their remnant.’

**²¹** “Acquaint yourself with him now, and be at peace. By it, good will come to you.

**²²** Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.

**²³** If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.

**²⁴** Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.

**²⁵** The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you.

**²⁶** For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and will lift up your face to God.

**²⁷** You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You will pay your vows.

**²⁸** You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you. Light will shine on your ways.

**²⁹** When they cast down, you will say, ‘be lifted up.’ He will save the humble person.

**³⁰** He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
