# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation. 

<sup>3</sup> Allow me, and I also will speak. After I have spoken, mock on. 

<sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient? 

<sup>5</sup> Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh. 

<sup>7</sup> “Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power? 

<sup>8</sup> Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry. 

<sup>11</sup> They send out their little ones like a flock. Their children dance. 

<sup>12</sup> They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 

<sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol. 

<sup>14</sup> They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways. 

<sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’ 

<sup>16</sup> Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>17</sup> “How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger? 

<sup>18</sup> How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away? 

<sup>19</sup> You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it. 

<sup>20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

<sup>21</sup> For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 

<sup>22</sup> “Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high? 

<sup>23</sup> One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 

<sup>24</sup> His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened. 

<sup>25</sup> Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good. 

<sup>26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them. 

<sup>27</sup> “Behold, I know your thoughts, the plans with which you would wrong me. 

<sup>28</sup> For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’ 

<sup>29</sup> Haven’t you asked wayfaring men? Don’t you know their evidences, 

<sup>30</sup> that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, that they are led out to the day of wrath? 

<sup>31</sup> Who will declare his way to his face? Who will repay him what he has done? 

<sup>32</sup> Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men will keep watch over the tomb. 

<sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley will be sweet to him. All men will draw after him, as there were innumerable before him. 

<sup>34</sup> So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”
