# Chapter 21

**¹** Then Job answered,

**²** “Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation.

**³** Allow me, and I also will speak. After I have spoken, mock on.

**⁴** As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient?

**⁵** Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth.

**⁶** When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh.

**⁷** “Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?

**⁸** Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes.

**⁹** Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.

**¹⁰** Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.

**¹¹** They send out their little ones like a flock. Their children dance.

**¹²** They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.

**¹³** They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol.[^410]

**¹⁴** They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways.

**¹⁵** What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’

**¹⁶** Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

**¹⁷** “How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger?

**¹⁸** How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?

**¹⁹** You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.

**²⁰** Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

**²¹** For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?

**²²** “Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high?

**²³** One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

**²⁴** His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened.

**²⁵** Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.

**²⁶** They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them.

**²⁷** “Behold, I know your thoughts, the plans with which you would wrong me.

**²⁸** For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’

**²⁹** Haven’t you asked wayfaring men? Don’t you know their evidences,

**³⁰** that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, that they are led out to the day of wrath?

**³¹** Who will declare his way to his face? Who will repay him what he has done?

**³²** Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men will keep watch over the tomb.

**³³** The clods of the valley will be sweet to him. All men will draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.

**³⁴** So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”

[^410]: 21:13 Sheol is the place of the dead.
