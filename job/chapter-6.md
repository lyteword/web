# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,

<sup>2</sup> “Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!

<sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore my words have been rash.

<sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.

<sup>5</sup> Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?

<sup>6</sup> Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

<sup>7</sup> My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me.

<sup>8</sup> “Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for,

<sup>9</sup> even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

<sup>10</sup> Let it still be my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

<sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient?

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze?

<sup>13</sup> Isn’t it that I have no help in me, that wisdom is driven away from me?

<sup>14</sup> “To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.

<sup>15</sup> My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;

<sup>16</sup> which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.

<sup>17</sup> In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

<sup>18</sup> The caravans that travel beside them turn away. They go up into the waste, and perish.

<sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.

<sup>20</sup> They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded.

<sup>21</sup> For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid.

<sup>22</sup> Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’? or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance’?

<sup>23</sup> or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’? or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?

<sup>24</sup> “Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand my error.

<sup>25</sup> How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?

<sup>26</sup> Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?

<sup>27</sup> Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.

<sup>28</sup> Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I will not lie to your face.

<sup>29</sup> Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.

<sup>30</sup> Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?
