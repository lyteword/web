# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> “Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 

<sup>2</sup> For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple. 

<sup>3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 

<sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them, 

<sup>5</sup> whose harvest the hungry eat up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance. 

<sup>6</sup> For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground; 

<sup>7</sup> but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 

<sup>8</sup> “But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God, 

<sup>9</sup> who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number; 

<sup>10</sup> who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields; 

<sup>11</sup> so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety. 

<sup>12</sup> He frustrates the plans of the crafty, so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise. 

<sup>13</sup> He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. 

<sup>14</sup> They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night. 

<sup>15</sup> But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty. 

<sup>16</sup> So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. 

<sup>18</sup> For he wounds and binds up. He injures and his hands make whole. 

<sup>19</sup> He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil will touch you. 

<sup>20</sup> In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword. 

<sup>21</sup> You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes. 

<sup>22</sup> You will laugh at destruction and famine, neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth. 

<sup>23</sup> For you will be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field will be at peace with you. 

<sup>24</sup> You will know that your tent is in peace. You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing. 

<sup>25</sup> You will know also that your offspring will be great, your offspring as the grass of the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> You will come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season. 

<sup>27</sup> Behold, we have researched it. It is so. Hear it, and know it for your good.”
