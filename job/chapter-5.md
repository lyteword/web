# Job 5 

**¹** “Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?

**²** For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.

**³** I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.

**⁴** His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,

**⁵** whose harvest the hungry eat up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.

**⁶** For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;

**⁷** but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

**⁸** “But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,

**⁹** who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number;

**¹⁰** who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;

**¹¹** so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety.

**¹²** He frustrates the plans of the crafty, so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.

**¹³** He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.

**¹⁴** They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night.

**¹⁵** But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

**¹⁶** So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.

**¹⁷** “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.

**¹⁸** For he wounds and binds up. He injures and his hands make whole.

**¹⁹** He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil will touch you.

**²⁰** In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword.

**²¹** You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.

**²²** You will laugh at destruction and famine, neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.

**²³** For you will be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field will be at peace with you.

**²⁴** You will know that your tent is in peace. You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.

**²⁵** You will know also that your offspring[^404] will be great, your offspring as the grass of the earth.

**²⁶** You will come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.

**²⁷** Behold, we have researched it. It is so. Hear it, and know it for your good.”

[^404]: 5:25 or, seed
