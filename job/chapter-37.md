# Job 37 

**¹** “Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place.

**²** Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth.

**³** He sends it out under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.

**⁴** After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.

**⁵** God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.

**⁶** For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.

**⁷** He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it.

**⁸** Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens.

**⁹** Out of its room comes the storm, and cold out of the north.

**¹⁰** By the breath of God, ice is given, and the width of the waters is frozen.

**¹¹** Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.

**¹²** It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,

**¹³** whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.

**¹⁴** “Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.

**¹⁵** Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?

**¹⁶** Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?

**¹⁷** You whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?

**¹⁸** Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror?

**¹⁹** Teach us what we will tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.

**²⁰** Will it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?

**²¹** Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them.

**²²** Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty.

**²³** We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.

**²⁴** Therefore men revere him. He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
