# Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> “Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> He sends it out under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard. 

<sup>5</sup> God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend. 

<sup>6</sup> For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain. 

<sup>7</sup> He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it. 

<sup>8</sup> Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens. 

<sup>9</sup> Out of its room comes the storm, and cold out of the north. 

<sup>10</sup> By the breath of God, ice is given, and the width of the waters is frozen. 

<sup>11</sup> Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning. 

<sup>12</sup> It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world, 

<sup>13</sup> whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come. 

<sup>14</sup> “Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 

<sup>15</sup> Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? 

<sup>16</sup> Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 

<sup>17</sup> You whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind? 

<sup>18</sup> Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror? 

<sup>19</sup> Teach us what we will tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness. 

<sup>20</sup> Will it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 

<sup>21</sup> Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them. 

<sup>22</sup> Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty. 

<sup>23</sup> We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress. 

<sup>24</sup> Therefore men revere him. He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
