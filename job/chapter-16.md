# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters! 

<sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 

<sup>4</sup> I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul’s place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you, 

<sup>5</sup> but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you. 

<sup>6</sup> “Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased? 

<sup>7</sup> But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made all my company desolate. 

<sup>8</sup> You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face. 

<sup>9</sup> He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me. 

<sup>10</sup> They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me. 

<sup>11</sup> God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target. 

<sup>13</sup> His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my bile on the ground. 

<sup>14</sup> He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs at me like a giant. 

<sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids, 

<sup>17</sup> although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 

<sup>18</sup> “Earth, don’t cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest. 

<sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high. 

<sup>20</sup> My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God, 

<sup>21</sup> that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor! 

<sup>22</sup> For when a few years have come, I will go the way of no return.
