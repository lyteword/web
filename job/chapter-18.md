# Job 18 

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

**²** “How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.

**³** Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight?

**⁴** You who tear yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken for you? Or will the rock be removed out of its place?

**⁵** “Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out. The spark of his fire won’t shine.

**⁶** The light will be dark in his tent. His lamp above him will be put out.

**⁷** The steps of his strength will be shortened. His own counsel will cast him down.

**⁸** For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh.

**⁹** A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him.

**¹⁰** A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him on the path.

**¹¹** Terrors will make him afraid on every side, and will chase him at his heels.

**¹²** His strength will be famished. Calamity will be ready at his side.

**¹³** The members of his body will be devoured. The firstborn of death will devour his members.

**¹⁴** He will be rooted out of the security of his tent. He will be brought to the king of terrors.

**¹⁵** There will dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur will be scattered on his habitation.

**¹⁶** His roots will be dried up beneath. His branch will be cut off above.

**¹⁷** His memory will perish from the earth. He will have no name in the street.

**¹⁸** He will be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.

**¹⁹** He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived.

**²⁰** Those who come after will be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened.

**²¹** Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
