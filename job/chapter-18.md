# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak. 

<sup>3</sup> Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight? 

<sup>4</sup> You who tear yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken for you? Or will the rock be removed out of its place? 

<sup>5</sup> “Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out. The spark of his fire won’t shine. 

<sup>6</sup> The light will be dark in his tent. His lamp above him will be put out. 

<sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength will be shortened. His own counsel will cast him down. 

<sup>8</sup> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh. 

<sup>9</sup> A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him. 

<sup>10</sup> A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him on the path. 

<sup>11</sup> Terrors will make him afraid on every side, and will chase him at his heels. 

<sup>12</sup> His strength will be famished. Calamity will be ready at his side. 

<sup>13</sup> The members of his body will be devoured. The firstborn of death will devour his members. 

<sup>14</sup> He will be rooted out of the security of his tent. He will be brought to the king of terrors. 

<sup>15</sup> There will dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur will be scattered on his habitation. 

<sup>16</sup> His roots will be dried up beneath. His branch will be cut off above. 

<sup>17</sup> His memory will perish from the earth. He will have no name in the street. 

<sup>18</sup> He will be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 

<sup>19</sup> He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived. 

<sup>20</sup> Those who come after will be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened. 

<sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
