# Job 40 

**¹** Moreover Yahweh answered Job,

**²** “Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”

**³** Then Job answered Yahweh,

**⁴** “Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.

**⁵** I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”

**⁶** Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind:

**⁷** “Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.

**⁸** Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?

**⁹** Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?

**¹⁰** “Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.

**¹¹** Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.

**¹²** Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.

**¹³** Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.

**¹⁴** Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.

**¹⁵** “See now behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.

**¹⁶** Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.

**¹⁷** He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.

**¹⁸** His bones are like tubes of bronze. His limbs are like bars of iron.

**¹⁹** He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.

**²⁰** Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.

**²¹** He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.

**²²** The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.

**²³** Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.

**²⁴** Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
