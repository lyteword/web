# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Yahweh answered Job,

<sup>2</sup> “Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”

<sup>3</sup> Then Job answered Yahweh,

<sup>4</sup> “Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.

<sup>5</sup> I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”

<sup>6</sup> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind:

<sup>7</sup> “Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.

<sup>8</sup> Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?

<sup>9</sup> Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?

<sup>10</sup> “Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.

<sup>11</sup> Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.

<sup>12</sup> Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.

<sup>14</sup> Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.

<sup>15</sup> “See now behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.

<sup>16</sup> Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.

<sup>17</sup> He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.

<sup>18</sup> His bones are like tubes of bronze. His limbs are like bars of iron.

<sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.

<sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.

<sup>21</sup> He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.

<sup>22</sup> The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.

<sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.

<sup>24</sup> Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
