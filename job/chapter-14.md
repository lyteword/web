# Job 14 

**¹** “Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.

**²** He grows up like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue.

**³** Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you?

**⁴** Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.

**⁵** Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass.

**⁶** Look away from him, that he may rest, until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day.

**⁷** “For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease.

**⁸** Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground,

**⁹** yet through the scent of water it will bud, and sprout boughs like a plant.

**¹⁰** But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?

**¹¹** As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,

**¹²** so man lies down and doesn’t rise. Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.

**¹³** “Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,[^407] that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time and remember me!

**¹⁴** If a man dies, will he live again? I would wait all the days of my warfare, until my release should come.

**¹⁵** You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire for the work of your hands.

**¹⁶** But now you count my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin?

**¹⁷** My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.

**¹⁸** “But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place.

**¹⁹** The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man.

**²⁰** You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away.

**²¹** His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.

**²²** But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.”

[^407]: 14:13 Sheol is the place of the dead.
