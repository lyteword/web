# Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, 

<sup>2</sup> “Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge? 

<sup>3</sup> Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you, then you answer me! 

<sup>4</sup> “Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding. 

<sup>5</sup> Who determined its measures, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it? 

<sup>6</sup> What were its foundations fastened on? Or who laid its cornerstone, 

<sup>7</sup> when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

<sup>8</sup> “Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke out of the womb, 

<sup>9</sup> when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness, 

<sup>10</sup> marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors, 

<sup>11</sup> and said, ‘You may come here, but no further. Your proud waves shall be stopped here’? 

<sup>12</sup> “Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused the dawn to know its place, 

<sup>13</sup> that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it? 

<sup>14</sup> It is changed as clay under the seal, and presented as a garment. 

<sup>15</sup> From the wicked, their light is withheld. The high arm is broken. 

<sup>16</sup> “Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep? 

<sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? 

<sup>18</sup> Have you comprehended the earth in its width? Declare, if you know it all. 

<sup>19</sup> “What is the way to the dwelling of light? As for darkness, where is its place, 

<sup>20</sup> that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern the paths to its house? 

<sup>21</sup> Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great! 

<sup>22</sup> Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail, 

<sup>23</sup> which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 

<sup>24</sup> By what way is the lightning distributed, or the east wind scattered on the earth? 

<sup>25</sup> Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path for the thunderstorm, 

<sup>26</sup> to cause it to rain on a land where there is no man, on the wilderness, in which there is no man, 

<sup>27</sup> to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender grass to grow? 

<sup>28</sup> Does the rain have a father? Or who fathers the drops of dew? 

<sup>29</sup> Whose womb did the ice come out of? Who has given birth to the gray frost of the sky? 

<sup>30</sup> The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen. 

<sup>31</sup> “Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion? 

<sup>32</sup> Can you lead the constellations out in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs? 

<sup>33</sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you establish its dominion over the earth? 

<sup>34</sup> “Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover you? 

<sup>35</sup> Can you send out lightnings, that they may go? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’? 

<sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind? 

<sup>37</sup> Who can count the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the containers of the sky, 

<sup>38</sup> when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of earth stick together? 

<sup>39</sup> “Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 

<sup>40</sup> when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket? 

<sup>41</sup> Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of food?
