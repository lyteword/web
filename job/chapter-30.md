# Job 30 

**¹** “But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs.

**²** Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished?

**³** They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.

**⁴** They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom tree are their food.

**⁵** They are driven out from among men. They cry after them as after a thief,

**⁶** so that they live in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.

**⁷** They bray among the bushes. They are gathered together under the nettles.

**⁸** They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men. They were flogged out of the land.

**⁹** “Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them.

**¹⁰** They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.

**¹¹** For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me.

**¹²** On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet. They cast their ways of destruction up against me.

**¹³** They mar my path. They promote my destruction without anyone’s help.

**¹⁴** As through a wide breach they come. They roll themselves in amid the ruin.

**¹⁵** Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud.

**¹⁶** “Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold of me.

**¹⁷** In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.

**¹⁸** My garment is disfigured by great force. It binds me about as the collar of my tunic.

**¹⁹** He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes.

**²⁰** I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me.

**²¹** You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me.

**²²** You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm.

**²³** For I know that you will bring me to death, to the house appointed for all living.

**²⁴** “However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?

**²⁵** Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?

**²⁶** When I looked for good, then evil came. When I waited for light, darkness came.

**²⁷** My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest. Days of affliction have come on me.

**²⁸** I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.

**²⁹** I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.

**³⁰** My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat.

**³¹** Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
