# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> “But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs. 

<sup>2</sup> Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished? 

<sup>3</sup> They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation. 

<sup>4</sup> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom tree are their food. 

<sup>5</sup> They are driven out from among men. They cry after them as after a thief, 

<sup>6</sup> so that they live in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks. 

<sup>7</sup> They bray among the bushes. They are gathered together under the nettles. 

<sup>8</sup> They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men. They were flogged out of the land. 

<sup>9</sup> “Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them. 

<sup>10</sup> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don’t hesitate to spit in my face. 

<sup>11</sup> For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me. 

<sup>12</sup> On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet. They cast their ways of destruction up against me. 

<sup>13</sup> They mar my path. They promote my destruction without anyone’s help. 

<sup>14</sup> As through a wide breach they come. They roll themselves in amid the ruin. 

<sup>15</sup> Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> “Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold of me. 

<sup>17</sup> In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. 

<sup>18</sup> My garment is disfigured by great force. It binds me about as the collar of my tunic. 

<sup>19</sup> He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes. 

<sup>20</sup> I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me. 

<sup>21</sup> You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me. 

<sup>22</sup> You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm. 

<sup>23</sup> For I know that you will bring me to death, to the house appointed for all living. 

<sup>24</sup> “However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help? 

<sup>25</sup> Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy? 

<sup>26</sup> When I looked for good, then evil came. When I waited for light, darkness came. 

<sup>27</sup> My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest. Days of affliction have come on me. 

<sup>28</sup> I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. 

<sup>29</sup> I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches. 

<sup>30</sup> My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat. 

<sup>31</sup> Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
