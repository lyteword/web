# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?

<sup>3</sup> Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

<sup>4</sup> If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.

<sup>5</sup> If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty.

<sup>6</sup> If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.

<sup>7</sup> Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase.

<sup>8</sup> “Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.

<sup>9</sup> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)

<sup>10</sup> Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart?

<sup>11</sup> “Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?

<sup>12</sup> While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed.

<sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man will perish,

<sup>14</sup> whose confidence will break apart, whose trust is a spider’s web.

<sup>15</sup> He will lean on his house, but it will not stand. He will cling to it, but it will not endure.

<sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun. His shoots go out along his garden.

<sup>17</sup> His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.

<sup>18</sup> If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’

<sup>19</sup> Behold, this is the joy of his way. Out of the earth, others will spring.

<sup>20</sup> “Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers.

<sup>21</sup> He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.

<sup>22</sup> Those who hate you will be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked will be no more.”
