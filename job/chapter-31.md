# Job 31 

**¹** “I made a covenant with my eyes; how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?

**²** For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high?

**³** Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?

**⁴** Doesn’t he see my ways, and count all my steps?

**⁵** “If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit

**⁶** (let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity);

**⁷** if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands,

**⁸** then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.

**⁹** “If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,

**¹⁰** then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her.

**¹¹** For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,

**¹²** for it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase.

**¹³** “If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me,

**¹⁴** what then will I do when God rises up? When he visits, what will I answer him?

**¹⁵** Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him? Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?

**¹⁶** “If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

**¹⁷** or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it

**¹⁸** (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, I have guided her from my mother’s womb);

**¹⁹** if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;

**²⁰** if his heart hasn’t blessed me, if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;

**²¹** if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate;

**²²** then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.

**²³** For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.

**²⁴** “If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’

**²⁵** If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;

**²⁶** if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor,

**²⁷** and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth;

**²⁸** this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have denied the God who is above.

**²⁹** “If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him

**³⁰** (I have certainly not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse);

**³¹** if the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’

**³²** (the foreigner has not camped in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler);

**³³** if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart,

**³⁴** because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—

**³⁵** oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me! Let the accuser write my indictment!

**³⁶** Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, and I would bind it to me as a crown.

**³⁷** I would declare to him the number of my steps. I would go near to him like a prince.

**³⁸** If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together;

**³⁹** if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life,

**⁴⁰** let briers grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.
