# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> “I made a covenant with my eyes; how then should I look lustfully at a young woman? 

<sup>2</sup> For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high? 

<sup>3</sup> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> Doesn’t he see my ways, and count all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> “If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit 

<sup>6</sup> (let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity); 

<sup>7</sup> if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands, 

<sup>8</sup> then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> “If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door, 

<sup>10</sup> then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her. 

<sup>11</sup> For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, 

<sup>12</sup> for it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase. 

<sup>13</sup> “If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me, 

<sup>14</sup> what then will I do when God rises up? When he visits, what will I answer him? 

<sup>15</sup> Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him? Didn’t one fashion us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> “If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

<sup>17</sup> or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 

<sup>18</sup> (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, I have guided her from my mother’s womb); 

<sup>19</sup> if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 

<sup>20</sup> if his heart hasn’t blessed me, if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece; 

<sup>21</sup> if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate; 

<sup>22</sup> then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone. 

<sup>23</sup> For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because of his majesty, I can do nothing. 

<sup>24</sup> “If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’ 

<sup>25</sup> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; 

<sup>26</sup> if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor, 

<sup>27</sup> and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth; 

<sup>28</sup> this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have denied the God who is above. 

<sup>29</sup> “If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him 

<sup>30</sup> (I have certainly not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse); 

<sup>31</sup> if the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’ 

<sup>32</sup> (the foreigner has not camped in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler); 

<sup>33</sup> if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart, 

<sup>34</sup> because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door— 

<sup>35</sup> oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me! Let the accuser write my indictment! 

<sup>36</sup> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, and I would bind it to me as a crown. 

<sup>37</sup> I would declare to him the number of my steps. I would go near to him like a prince. 

<sup>38</sup> If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together; 

<sup>39</sup> if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life, 

<sup>40</sup> let briers grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.
