# Chapter 33

**¹** “However, Job, please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.

**²** See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth.

**³** My words will utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.

**⁴** The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

**⁵** If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand up.

**⁶** Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay.

**⁷** Behold, my terror will not make you afraid, neither will my pressure be heavy on you.

**⁸** “Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying,

**⁹** ‘I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.

**¹⁰** Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.

**¹¹** He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.’

**¹²** “Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man.

**¹³** Why do you strive against him, because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?

**¹⁴** For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.

**¹⁵** In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed,

**¹⁶** then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,

**¹⁷** that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.

**¹⁸** He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

**¹⁹** “He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones,

**²⁰** so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.

**²¹** His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.

**²²** Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.

**²³** “If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him,

**²⁴** then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’

**²⁵** His flesh will be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.

**²⁶** He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness.

**²⁷** He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me.

**²⁸** He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.’

**²⁹** “Behold, God does all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man,

**³⁰** to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

**³¹** Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak.

**³²** If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you.

**³³** If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”
