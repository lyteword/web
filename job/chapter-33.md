# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> “However, Job, please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.

<sup>2</sup> See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth.

<sup>3</sup> My words will utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.

<sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

<sup>5</sup> If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand up.

<sup>6</sup> Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay.

<sup>7</sup> Behold, my terror will not make you afraid, neither will my pressure be heavy on you.

<sup>8</sup> “Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying,

<sup>9</sup> ‘I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.

<sup>10</sup> Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.

<sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.’

<sup>12</sup> “Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man.

<sup>13</sup> Why do you strive against him, because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?

<sup>14</sup> For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.

<sup>15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed,

<sup>16</sup> then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,

<sup>17</sup> that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.

<sup>18</sup> He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

<sup>19</sup> “He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones,

<sup>20</sup> so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.

<sup>21</sup> His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.

<sup>22</sup> Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.

<sup>23</sup> “If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him,

<sup>24</sup> then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’

<sup>25</sup> His flesh will be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.

<sup>26</sup> He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness.

<sup>27</sup> He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me.

<sup>28</sup> He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.’

<sup>29</sup> “Behold, God does all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man,

<sup>30</sup> to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

<sup>31</sup> Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak.

<sup>32</sup> If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you.

<sup>33</sup> If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”
