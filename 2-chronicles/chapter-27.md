# Chapter 27

**¹** Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.

**²** He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly.

**³** He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.

**⁴** Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.

**⁵** He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents[^364] of silver, ten thousand cors[^365] of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley.[^366] The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third.

**⁶** So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.

**⁷** Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

**⁸** He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

**⁹** Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.

[^364]: 27:5 A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds
[^365]: 27:5 1 cor is the same as a homer, or about 55.9 U. S. gallons (liquid) or 211 liters or 6 bushels. 10,000 cors of wheat would weigh about 1,640 metric tons.
[^366]: 27:5 10,000 cors of barley would weigh about 1,310 metric tons.
