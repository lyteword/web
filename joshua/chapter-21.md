**⁴¹** All the cities of the Levites among the possessions of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.

**⁴²** Each of these cities included their pasture lands around them. It was this way with all these cities.

**⁴³** So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in it.

**⁴⁴** Yahweh gave them rest all around, according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand.

**⁴⁵** Nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.
