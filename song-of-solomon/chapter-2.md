# Song Of Solomon 2 

Beloved

**¹** I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.

Lover

**²** As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

Beloved

**³** As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste.

**⁴** He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love.

**⁵** Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love.

**⁶** His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me.

**⁷** I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.

**⁸** The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.

**⁹** My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.

**¹⁰** My beloved spoke, and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.

**¹¹** For behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.

**¹²** The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

**¹³** The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom. They give out their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.”

Lover

**¹⁴** My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountainside, let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.

**¹⁵** Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that plunder the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.

Beloved

**¹⁶** My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies.

**¹⁷** Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.
