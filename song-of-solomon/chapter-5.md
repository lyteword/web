# Chapter 5

Lover

<sup>1</sup> I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.

Friends Eat, friends! Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.

Beloved

<sup>2</sup> I was asleep, but my heart was awake. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: “Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night.”

<sup>3</sup> I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?

<sup>4</sup> My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him.

<sup>5</sup> I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.

<sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left, and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke. I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. I called him, but he didn’t answer.

<sup>7</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.

<sup>8</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am faint with love.

Friends

<sup>9</sup> How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, that you do so adjure us?

Beloved

<sup>10</sup> My beloved is white and ruddy. The best among ten thousand.

<sup>11</sup> His head is like the purest gold. His hair is bushy, black as a raven.

<sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels.

<sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

<sup>14</sup> His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.

<sup>15</sup> His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

<sup>16</sup> His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
