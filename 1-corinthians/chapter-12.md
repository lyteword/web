# 1 Corinthians 12 

**¹** Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.

**²** You know that when you were heathen,[^1203] you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.

**³** Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.

**⁴** Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.

**⁵** There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.

**⁶** There are various kinds of workings, but the same God who works all things in all.

**⁷** But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.

**⁸** For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,

**⁹** to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,

**¹⁰** and to another workings of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of languages, and to another the interpretation of languages.

**¹¹** But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.

**¹²** For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.

**¹³** For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.

**¹⁴** For the body is not one member, but many.

**¹⁵** If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.

**¹⁶** If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.

**¹⁷** If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?

**¹⁸** But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.

**¹⁹** If they were all one member, where would the body be?

**²⁰** But now they are many members, but one body.

**²¹** The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”

**²²** No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.

**²³** Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty,

**²⁴** while our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,

**²⁵** that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.

**²⁶** When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

**²⁷** Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.

**²⁸** God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.

**²⁹** Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?

**³⁰** Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?

**³¹** But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
