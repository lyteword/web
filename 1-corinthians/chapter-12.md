# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant. 

<sup>2</sup> You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>4</sup> Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> There are various kinds of workings, but the same God who works all things in all. 

<sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all. 

<sup>8</sup> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 

<sup>9</sup> to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 

<sup>10</sup> and to another workings of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of languages, and to another the interpretation of languages. 

<sup>11</sup> But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many. 

<sup>15</sup> If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body. 

<sup>16</sup> If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body. 

<sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be? 

<sup>18</sup> But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired. 

<sup>19</sup> If they were all one member, where would the body be? 

<sup>20</sup> But now they are many members, but one body. 

<sup>21</sup> The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.” 

<sup>22</sup> No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. 

<sup>23</sup> Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty, 

<sup>24</sup> while our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part, 

<sup>25</sup> that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. 

<sup>26</sup> When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. 

<sup>27</sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. 

<sup>28</sup> God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages. 

<sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers? 

<sup>30</sup> Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret? 

<sup>31</sup> But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
