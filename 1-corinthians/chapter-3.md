# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.

<sup>2</sup> I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,

<sup>3</sup> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?

<sup>4</sup> For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?

<sup>5</sup> Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?

<sup>6</sup> I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.

<sup>7</sup> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.

<sup>8</sup> Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.

<sup>9</sup> For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.

<sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.

<sup>11</sup> For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.

<sup>12</sup> But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,

<sup>13</sup> each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.

<sup>14</sup> If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.

<sup>15</sup> If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.

<sup>16</sup> Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?

<sup>17</sup> If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.

<sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.

<sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”[^1190]

<sup>20</sup> And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”[^1191]

<sup>21</sup> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,

<sup>22</sup> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,

<sup>23</sup> and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.
