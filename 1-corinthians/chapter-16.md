# Chapter 16

**¹** Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.

**²** On the first day of every week, let each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come.

**³** When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.

**⁴** If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.

**⁵** I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.

**⁶** But with you it may be that I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.

**⁷** For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.

**⁸** But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,

**⁹** for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.

**¹⁰** Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.

**¹¹** Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.

**¹²** Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.

**¹³** Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!

**¹⁴** Let all that you do be done in love.

**¹⁵** Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints—

**¹⁶** that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.

**¹⁷** I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.

**¹⁸** For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.

**¹⁹** The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.

**²⁰** All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

**²¹** This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.

**²²** If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed.[^1216] Come, Lord![^1217]

**²³** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

**²⁴** My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.

[^1216]: 16:22 Greek: anathema.
[^1217]: 16:22 Aramaic: Maranatha!
