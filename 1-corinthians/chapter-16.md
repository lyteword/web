# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise. 

<sup>2</sup> On the first day of every week, let each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come. 

<sup>3</sup> When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me. 

<sup>5</sup> I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia. 

<sup>6</sup> But with you it may be that I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go. 

<sup>7</sup> For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits. 

<sup>8</sup> But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, 

<sup>9</sup> for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. 

<sup>10</sup> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do. 

<sup>11</sup> Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers. 

<sup>12</sup> Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity. 

<sup>13</sup> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong! 

<sup>14</sup> Let all that you do be done in love. 

<sup>15</sup> Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints— 

<sup>16</sup> that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. 

<sup>17</sup> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied. 

<sup>18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that. 

<sup>19</sup> The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house. 

<sup>20</sup> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

<sup>21</sup> This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand. 

<sup>22</sup> If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed. Come, Lord! 

<sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

<sup>24</sup> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
