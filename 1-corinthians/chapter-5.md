# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. 

<sup>2</sup> You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you. 

<sup>3</sup> For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. 

<sup>4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>5</sup> you are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? 

<sup>7</sup> Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. 

<sup>8</sup> Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 

<sup>9</sup> I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; 

<sup>10</sup> yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world. 

<sup>11</sup> But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person. 

<sup>12</sup> For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? 

<sup>13</sup> But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”
