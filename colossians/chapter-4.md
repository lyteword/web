# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. 

<sup>2</sup> Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving, 

<sup>3</sup> praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, 

<sup>4</sup> that I may reveal it as I ought to speak. 

<sup>5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. 

<sup>6</sup> Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one. 

<sup>7</sup> All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 

<sup>9</sup> together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here. 

<sup>10</sup> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”), 

<sup>11</sup> and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me. 

<sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 

<sup>13</sup> For I testify about him that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis. 

<sup>14</sup> Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 

<sup>15</sup> Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, with Nymphas and the assembly that is in his house. 

<sup>16</sup> When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 

<sup>17</sup> Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.” 

<sup>18</sup> I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
