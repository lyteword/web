# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.

<sup>2</sup> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.

<sup>3</sup> For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

<sup>4</sup> When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.

<sup>5</sup> Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

<sup>6</sup> For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.

<sup>7</sup> You also once walked in those, when you lived in them,

<sup>8</sup> but now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.

<sup>9</sup> Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,

<sup>10</sup> and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,

<sup>11</sup> where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free person; but Christ is all, and in all.

<sup>12</sup> Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;

<sup>13</sup> bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.

<sup>14</sup> Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.

<sup>15</sup> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful.

<sup>16</sup> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.

<sup>17</sup> Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

<sup>18</sup> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

<sup>19</sup> Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.

<sup>20</sup> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.

<sup>21</sup> Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.

<sup>22</sup> Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

<sup>23</sup> And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,

<sup>24</sup> knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.

<sup>25</sup> But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.
