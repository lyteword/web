# Chapter 10

**¹** Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.

**²** A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left.

**³** Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.

**⁴** If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.

**⁵** There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.

**⁶** Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.

**⁷** I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.

**⁸** He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.

**⁹** Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it.

**¹⁰** If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.

**¹¹** If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.

**¹²** The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.

**¹³** The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

**¹⁴** A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?

**¹⁵** The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.

**¹⁶** Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!

**¹⁷** Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

**¹⁸** By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.

**¹⁹** A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things.

**²⁰** Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom, for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.
