# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. 

<sup>2</sup> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left. 

<sup>3</sup> Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool. 

<sup>4</sup> If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest. 

<sup>5</sup> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler. 

<sup>6</sup> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place. 

<sup>7</sup> I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 

<sup>9</sup> Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it. 

<sup>10</sup> If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success. 

<sup>11</sup> If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue. 

<sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips. 

<sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 

<sup>14</sup> A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him? 

<sup>15</sup> The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city. 

<sup>16</sup> Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning! 

<sup>17</sup> Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 

<sup>18</sup> By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. 

<sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things. 

<sup>20</sup> Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom, for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.
