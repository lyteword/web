# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:

<sup>2</sup> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”

<sup>3</sup> What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?

<sup>4</sup> One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.

<sup>5</sup> The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.

<sup>6</sup> The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.

<sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.

<sup>8</sup> All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

<sup>9</sup> That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.

<sup>10</sup> Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,[^481] this is new”? It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.

<sup>11</sup> There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.

<sup>12</sup> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God[^482] has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.

<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.

<sup>15</sup> That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.

<sup>16</sup> I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”

<sup>17</sup> I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.

<sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

[^481]: 1:10 “Behold”, from “ הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
[^482]: 1:13 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
