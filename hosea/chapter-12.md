# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Ephraim feeds on wind, and chases the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and desolation. They make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his deeds he will repay him. 

<sup>3</sup> In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he contended with God. 

<sup>4</sup> Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him. He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us— 

<sup>5</sup> even Yahweh, the God of Armies. Yahweh is his name of renown! 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore turn to your God. Keep kindness and justice, and wait continually for your God. 

<sup>7</sup> A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand. He loves to defraud. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich. I have found myself wealth. In all my wealth they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.” 

<sup>9</sup> “But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt. I will yet again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. 

<sup>10</sup> I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables. 

<sup>11</sup> If Gilead is wicked, surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls. Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field. 

<sup>12</sup> Jacob fled into the country of Aram. Israel served to get a wife. For a wife he tended flocks and herds. 

<sup>13</sup> By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved. 

<sup>14</sup> Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger. Therefore his blood will be left on him, and his Lord will repay his contempt.
