# Chapter 5

**¹** “Listen to this, you priests! Listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king! For the judgment is against you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.

**²** The rebels are deep in slaughter, but I discipline all of them.

**³** I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. Israel is defiled.

**⁴** Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God, for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don’t know Yahweh.

**⁵** The pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. Judah also will stumble with them.

**⁶** They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh, but they won’t find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.

**⁷** They are unfaithful to Yahweh; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.

**⁸** “Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!

**⁹** Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.

**¹⁰** The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. I will pour out my wrath on them like water.

**¹¹** Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment, because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.

**¹²** Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like rottenness.

**¹³** “When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.

**¹⁴** For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear in pieces and go away. I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.

**¹⁵** I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”
