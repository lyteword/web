# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> “When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

<sup>2</sup> They called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images. 

<sup>3</sup> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them by their arms, but they didn’t know that I healed them. 

<sup>4</sup> I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; and I bent down to him and I fed him. 

<sup>5</sup> “They won’t return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to repent. 

<sup>6</sup> The sword will fall on their cities, and will destroy the bars of their gates, and will put an end to their plans. 

<sup>7</sup> My people are determined to turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, he certainly won’t exalt them. 

<sup>8</sup> “How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused. 

<sup>9</sup> I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath. 

<sup>10</sup> They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west. 

<sup>11</sup> They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh. 

<sup>12</sup> Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. Judah still strays from God, and is unfaithful to the Holy One.
