# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, also the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers ravages outside. 

<sup>2</sup> They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face. 

<sup>3</sup> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

<sup>4</sup> They are all adulterers. They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened. 

<sup>5</sup> On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He joined his hand with mockers. 

<sup>6</sup> For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their anger smolders all night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire. 

<sup>7</sup> They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to me. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim mixes himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over. 

<sup>9</sup> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn’t realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he doesn’t realize it. 

<sup>10</sup> The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this. 

<sup>11</sup> “Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria. 

<sup>12</sup> When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard. 

<sup>13</sup> Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 

<sup>14</sup> They haven’t cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me. 

<sup>15</sup> Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me. 

<sup>16</sup> They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
