# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations; for you were unfaithful to your God. You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor. 

<sup>2</sup> The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them, and the new wine will fail her. 

<sup>3</sup> They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria. 

<sup>4</sup> They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into Yahweh’s house. 

<sup>5</sup> What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh? 

<sup>6</sup> For, behold, when they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents. 

<sup>7</sup> The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great. 

<sup>8</sup> A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God. 

<sup>9</sup> They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will punish them for their sins. 

<sup>10</sup> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved. 

<sup>11</sup> As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception. 

<sup>12</sup> Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them! 

<sup>13</sup> I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer. 

<sup>14</sup> Give them—Yahweh what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 

<sup>15</sup> “All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes are rebels. 

<sup>16</sup> Ephraim is struck. Their root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.” 

<sup>17</sup> My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.
