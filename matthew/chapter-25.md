# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> “Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 

<sup>2</sup> Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 

<sup>3</sup> Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, 

<sup>4</sup> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

<sup>5</sup> Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. 

<sup>6</sup> But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ 

<sup>7</sup> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 

<sup>8</sup> The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 

<sup>9</sup> But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’ 

<sup>10</sup> While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. 

<sup>11</sup> Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’ 

<sup>12</sup> But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’ 

<sup>13</sup> Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> “For it is like a man going into another country, who called his own servants and entrusted his goods to them. 

<sup>15</sup> To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. 

<sup>16</sup> Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. 

<sup>17</sup> In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two. 

<sup>18</sup> But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth and hid his lord’s money. 

<sup>19</sup> “Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and settled accounts with them. 

<sup>20</sup> He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents in addition to them.’ 

<sup>21</sup> “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ 

<sup>22</sup> “He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents in addition to them.’ 

<sup>23</sup> “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things. I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ 

<sup>24</sup> “He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow, and gathering where you didn’t scatter. 

<sup>25</sup> I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’ 

<sup>26</sup> “But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter. 

<sup>27</sup> You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest. 

<sup>28</sup> Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 

<sup>29</sup> For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away. 

<sup>30</sup> Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 

<sup>31</sup> “But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. 

<sup>32</sup> Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 

<sup>33</sup> He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

<sup>34</sup> Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; 

<sup>35</sup> for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. 

<sup>36</sup> I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.’ 

<sup>37</sup> “Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? 

<sup>38</sup> When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? 

<sup>39</sup> When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’ 

<sup>40</sup> “The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ 

<sup>41</sup> Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels; 

<sup>42</sup> for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; 

<sup>43</sup> I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’ 

<sup>44</sup> “Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’ 

<sup>45</sup> “Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’ 

<sup>46</sup> These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
