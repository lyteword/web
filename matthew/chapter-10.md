# Chapter 10

**¹** He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

**²** Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;

**³** Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called[^701] Thaddaeus;

**⁴** Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

**⁵** Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them, saying,  “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans.

**⁶**  Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

**⁷**  As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’

**⁸**  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,[^702]  and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.

**⁹**  Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts.

**¹⁰**  Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor sandals, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.

**¹¹**  Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go on.

**¹²**  As you enter into the household, greet it.

**¹³**  If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you.

**¹⁴**  Whoever doesn’t receive you or hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.

**¹⁵**  Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

**¹⁶**  “Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

**¹⁷**  But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.

**¹⁸**  Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.

**¹⁹**  But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.

**²⁰**  For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

**²¹**  “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.

**²²**  You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.

**²³**  But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man has come.

**²⁴**  “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.

**²⁵**  It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,[^703]  how much more those of his household!

**²⁶**  Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.

**²⁷**  What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.

**²⁸**  Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.[^704]

**²⁹**  “Aren’t two sparrows sold for an assarion coin?[^705]  Not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.

**³⁰**  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

**³¹**  Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.

**³²**  Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.

**³³**  But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.

**³⁴**  “Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword.

**³⁵**  For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

**³⁶**  A man’s foes will be those of his own household.[^706]

**³⁷**  He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me.

**³⁸**  He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me isn’t worthy of me.

**³⁹**  He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.

**⁴⁰**  “He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.

**⁴¹**  He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.

**⁴²**  Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.”
