# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,

<sup>2</sup> “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”

<sup>3</sup> He answered them,  “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?

<sup>4</sup>  For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’[^727]  and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’[^728]

<sup>5</sup>  But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”

<sup>6</sup>  he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.

<sup>7</sup>  You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

<sup>8</sup>  ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,  and honor me with their lips;  but their heart is far from me.

<sup>9</sup>  And they worship me in vain,  teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”[^729]

<sup>10</sup> He summoned the multitude, and said to them,  “Hear, and understand.

<sup>11</sup>  That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”

<sup>12</sup> Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”

<sup>13</sup> But he answered,  “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.

<sup>14</sup>  Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”

<sup>15</sup> Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”

<sup>16</sup> So Jesus said,  “Do you also still not understand?

<sup>17</sup>  Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body?

<sup>18</sup>  But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.

<sup>19</sup>  For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.

<sup>20</sup>  These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”

<sup>21</sup> Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

<sup>22</sup> Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”

<sup>23</sup> But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”

<sup>24</sup> But he answered,  “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

<sup>25</sup> But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”

<sup>26</sup> But he answered,  “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

<sup>27</sup> But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”

<sup>28</sup> Then Jesus answered her,  “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.

<sup>29</sup> Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there.

<sup>30</sup> Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,

<sup>31</sup> so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.

<sup>32</sup> Jesus summoned his disciples and said,  “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”

<sup>33</sup> The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”

<sup>34</sup> Jesus said to them,  “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”

<sup>35</sup> He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;

<sup>36</sup> and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

<sup>37</sup> They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.

<sup>38</sup> Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.

<sup>39</sup> Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
