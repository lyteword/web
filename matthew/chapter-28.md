# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. 

<sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 

<sup>4</sup> For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. 

<sup>5</sup> The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. 

<sup>6</sup> He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. 

<sup>7</sup> Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” 

<sup>8</sup> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 

<sup>9</sup> As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 

<sup>10</sup> Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.” 

<sup>11</sup> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. 

<sup>12</sup> When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, 

<sup>13</sup> saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. 

<sup>14</sup> If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” 

<sup>15</sup> So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today. 

<sup>16</sup> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. 

<sup>17</sup> When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. 

<sup>18</sup> Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. 

<sup>19</sup> Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

<sup>20</sup> teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.
