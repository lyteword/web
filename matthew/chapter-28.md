# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

<sup>2</sup> Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it.

<sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.

<sup>4</sup> For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.

<sup>5</sup> The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.

<sup>6</sup> He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.

<sup>7</sup> Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”

<sup>8</sup> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.

<sup>9</sup> As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,  “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.

<sup>10</sup> Then Jesus said to them,  “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers [^797]  that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”

<sup>11</sup> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.

<sup>12</sup> When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,

<sup>13</sup> saying, “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept.

<sup>14</sup> If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”

<sup>15</sup> So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.

<sup>16</sup> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.

<sup>17</sup> When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted.

<sup>18</sup> Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying,  “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

<sup>19</sup>  Go[^798]  and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

<sup>20</sup>  teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.

[^797]: 28:10 The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
[^798]: 28:19 TR and NU add “therefore”
