# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

<sup>2</sup> Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”

<sup>3</sup> Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,  “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

<sup>4</sup> Jesus said to him,  “See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”

<sup>5</sup> When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,

<sup>6</sup> saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”

<sup>7</sup> Jesus said to him,  “I will come and heal him.”

<sup>8</sup> The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

<sup>9</sup> For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

<sup>10</sup> When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed,  “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel.

<sup>11</sup>  I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,

<sup>12</sup>  but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

<sup>13</sup> Jesus said to the centurion,  “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour.

<sup>14</sup> When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.

<sup>15</sup> He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him.[^694]

<sup>16</sup> When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,

<sup>17</sup> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”[^695]

<sup>18</sup> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.

<sup>19</sup> A scribe came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”

<sup>20</sup> Jesus said to him,  “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”

<sup>21</sup> Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”

<sup>22</sup> But Jesus said to him,  “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”

<sup>23</sup> When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.

<sup>24</sup> Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.

<sup>25</sup> The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”

<sup>26</sup> He said to them,  “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”  Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.

<sup>27</sup> The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”

<sup>28</sup> When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,[^696] two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.

<sup>29</sup> Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”

<sup>30</sup> Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.

<sup>31</sup> The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”

<sup>32</sup> He said to them,  “Go!” They came out and went into the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water.

<sup>33</sup> Those who fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.

<sup>34</sup> Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
