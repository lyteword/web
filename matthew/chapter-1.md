# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 

<sup>2</sup> Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers. 

<sup>3</sup> Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. 

<sup>4</sup> Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. 

<sup>5</sup> Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. 

<sup>6</sup> Jesse became the father of King David. David the king became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife. 

<sup>7</sup> Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. 

<sup>8</sup> Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. 

<sup>9</sup> Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah. 

<sup>10</sup> Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. 

<sup>11</sup> Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. 

<sup>12</sup> After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel. 

<sup>13</sup> Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. 

<sup>14</sup> Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud. 

<sup>15</sup> Eliud became the father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob. 

<sup>16</sup> Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations. 

<sup>18</sup> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. 

<sup>20</sup> But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>21</sup> She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.” 

<sup>22</sup> Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 

<sup>23</sup> “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son. They shall call his name Immanuel,” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.” 

<sup>24</sup> Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; 

<sup>25</sup> and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
