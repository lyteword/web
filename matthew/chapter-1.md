**²** Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.

**³** Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.

**⁴** Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon.

**⁵** Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse.

**⁶** Jesse became the father of King David. David the king[^650] became the father of Solomon by her who had been Uriah’s wife.

**⁷** Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa.

**⁸** Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah.

**⁹** Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.

**¹⁰** Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.

**¹¹** Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

**¹²** After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.

**¹³** Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor.

**¹⁴** Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.

**¹⁶** Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus,[^651] who is called Christ.

**¹⁷** So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.

**¹⁸** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

**¹⁹** Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.

**²⁰** But when he thought about these things, behold,[^652] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.

**²¹** She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,[^653] for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”

**²²** Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

**²³** “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son. They shall call his name Immanuel,” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”[^654]

**²⁴** Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;

**²⁵** and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
