# Chapter 15

**¹** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**²** “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,

**³** and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh—a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock—

**⁴** then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah[^154] of fine flour mixed with one fourth of a hin[^155] of oil.

**⁵** You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.

**⁶** “‘For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah[^156] of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil;

**⁷** and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.

**⁸** When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh,

**⁹** then he shall offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah[^157] of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;

**¹⁰** and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.

**¹¹** Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.

**¹²** According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.

**¹³** “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.

**¹⁴** If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, as you do, so he shall do.

**¹⁵** For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As you are, so the foreigner shall be before Yahweh.

**¹⁶** One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’”

**¹⁷** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**¹⁸** “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,

**¹⁹** then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.

**²⁰** Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.

**²¹** Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.

**²²** “‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh has spoken to Moses—

**²³** even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—

**²⁴** then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.

**²⁵** The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.

**²⁶** All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.

**²⁷** “‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.

**²⁸** The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.

**²⁹** You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.

**³⁰** “‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.

**³¹** Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”

**³²** While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

**³³** Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

**³⁴** They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

**³⁵** Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.”

**³⁶** All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

**³⁷** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**³⁸** “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes[^158] on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe[^159] of each border a cord of blue.

**³⁹** It shall be to you for a fringe,[^160] that you may see it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you don’t follow your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to play the prostitute;

**⁴⁰** so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.

**⁴¹** I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.”
