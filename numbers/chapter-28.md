# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘See that you present my offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, as a pleasant aroma to me, in their due season.’ 

<sup>3</sup> You shall tell them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without defect, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. 

<sup>4</sup> You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening, 

<sup>5</sup> with one tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. 

<sup>6</sup> It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 

<sup>7</sup> Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for each lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place. 

<sup>8</sup> The other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the meal offering of the morning, and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. 

<sup>9</sup> “‘On the Sabbath day, you shall offer two male lambs a year old without defect, and two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mixed with oil, and its drink offering: 

<sup>10</sup> this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>11</sup> “‘In the beginnings of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without defect, 

<sup>12</sup> and three tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering mixed with oil, for the one ram; 

<sup>13</sup> and one tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb, as a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 

<sup>14</sup> Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. 

<sup>15</sup> Also, one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>16</sup> “‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh’s Passover. 

<sup>17</sup> On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast. Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 

<sup>18</sup> In the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work, 

<sup>19</sup> but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old. They shall be without defect, 

<sup>20</sup> with their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil. You shall offer three tenths for a bull, and two tenths for the ram. 

<sup>21</sup> You shall offer one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs; 

<sup>22</sup> and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you. 

<sup>23</sup> You shall offer these in addition to the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 

<sup>24</sup> In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. It shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>25</sup> On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work. 

<sup>26</sup> “‘Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work; 

<sup>27</sup> but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old; 

<sup>28</sup> and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenths for each bull, two tenths for the one ram, 

<sup>29</sup> one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs; 

<sup>30</sup> and one male goat, to make atonement for you. 

<sup>31</sup> Besides the continual burnt offering and its meal offering, you shall offer them and their drink offerings. See that they are without defect.
