# 1 Peter 5 

**¹** Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed:

**²** shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;

**³** not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.

**⁴** When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.

**⁵** Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”[^1385]

**⁶** Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,

**⁷** casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.

**⁸** Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

**⁹** Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.

**¹⁰** But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

**¹¹** To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.

**¹²** Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.

**¹³** She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you. So does Mark, my son.

**¹⁴** Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
