# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service. 

<sup>2</sup> The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore, select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 

<sup>4</sup> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.” 

<sup>5</sup> These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch, 

<sup>6</sup> whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 

<sup>7</sup> The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 

<sup>8</sup> Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. 

<sup>9</sup> But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen. 

<sup>10</sup> They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. 

<sup>11</sup> Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 

<sup>12</sup> They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council, 

<sup>13</sup> and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. 

<sup>14</sup> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” 

<sup>15</sup> All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
