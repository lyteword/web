# Chapter 6

**¹** Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists[^1036] against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.

**²** The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.

**³** Therefore, select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

**⁴** But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”

**⁵** These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,

**⁶** whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

**⁷** The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

**⁸** Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.

**⁹** But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.

**¹⁰** They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

**¹¹** Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”

**¹²** They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council,

**¹³** and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.

**¹⁴** For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”

**¹⁵** All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.

[^1036]: 6:1 The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.
