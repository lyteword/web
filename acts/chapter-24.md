# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul. 

<sup>2</sup> When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight, 

<sup>3</sup> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. 

<sup>5</sup> For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 

<sup>6</sup> He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.
