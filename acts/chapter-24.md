# Acts 24 

**¹** After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.

**²** When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight,

**³** we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.

**⁴** But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.

**⁵** For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

**⁶** He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.[^1096]

**⁷** [^1097]

**⁸** [^1098]By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”

**⁹** The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.

**¹⁰** When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,

**¹¹** seeing that you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.

**¹²** In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city.

**¹³** Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.

**¹⁴** But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;

**¹⁵** having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

**¹⁶** In this I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.

**¹⁷** Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;

**¹⁸** amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.

**¹⁹** They ought to have been here before you and to make accusation if they had anything against me.

**²⁰** Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,

**²¹** unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’”

**²²** But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”

**²³** He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.

**²⁴** After some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.

**²⁵** As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”

**²⁶** Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often and talked with him.

**²⁷** But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.

[^1096]: 24:6 TR adds “We wanted to judge him according to our law,”
[^1097]: 24:7 TR adds “but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,”
[^1098]: 24:8 TR adds “commanding his accusers to come to you.”
