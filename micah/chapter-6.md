# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Listen now to what Yahweh says: “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment, and you enduring foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a case against his people, and he will contend with Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me! 

<sup>4</sup> For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

<sup>5</sup> My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.” 

<sup>6</sup> How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? 

<sup>7</sup> Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 

<sup>8</sup> He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice calls to the city— and wisdom fears your name— “Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it. 

<sup>10</sup> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a short ephah that is accursed? 

<sup>11</sup> Shall I tolerate dishonest scales, and a bag of deceitful weights? 

<sup>12</sup> Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their speech. 

<sup>13</sup> Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. I have made you desolate because of your sins. 

<sup>14</sup> You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your hunger will be within you. You will store up, but not save, and that which you save I will give up to the sword. 

<sup>15</sup> You will sow, but won’t reap. You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine. 

<sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of Ahab’s house. You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and your inhabitants a hissing. You will bear the reproach of my people.”
