# Micah 6 

**¹** Listen now to what Yahweh says: “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say.

**²** Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment, and you enduring foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a case against his people, and he will contend with Israel.

**³** My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me!

**⁴** For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

**⁵** My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.”

**⁶** How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?

**⁷** Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

**⁸** He has shown you, O man, what is good. What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?

**⁹** Yahweh’s voice calls to the city— and wisdom fears your name— “Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it.

**¹⁰** Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a short ephah[^614] that is accursed?

**¹¹** Shall I tolerate dishonest scales, and a bag of deceitful weights?

**¹²** Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.

**¹³** Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. I have made you desolate because of your sins.

**¹⁴** You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your hunger will be within you. You will store up, but not save, and that which you save I will give up to the sword.

**¹⁵** You will sow, but won’t reap. You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.

**¹⁶** For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of Ahab’s house. You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and your inhabitants a hissing. You will bear the reproach of my people.”

[^614]: 6:10 An ephah is a measure of volume (about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel), and a short ephah is made smaller than a full ephah for the purpose of cheating customers.
