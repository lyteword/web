# 2 John 1 

**¹** The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,

**²** for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:

**³** Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,[^1401] the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

**⁴** I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.

**⁵** Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

**⁶** This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.

**⁷** For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.

**⁸** Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.

**⁹** Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

**¹⁰** If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,

**¹¹** for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.

**¹²** Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.

**¹³** The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.

[^1401]: 1:3 “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
