# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 

<sup>3</sup> His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice. 

<sup>4</sup> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah. 

<sup>5</sup> They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.” 

<sup>6</sup> But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” Samuel prayed to Yahweh. 

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them. 

<sup>8</sup> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do to you. 

<sup>9</sup> Now therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.” 

<sup>10</sup> Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked him for a king. 

<sup>11</sup> He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots. 

<sup>12</sup> He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots. 

<sup>13</sup> He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers. 

<sup>14</sup> He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best, and give them to his servants. 

<sup>15</sup> He will take one tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers and to his servants. 

<sup>16</sup> He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work. 

<sup>17</sup> He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants. 

<sup>18</sup> You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.” 

<sup>19</sup> But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us, 

<sup>20</sup> that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.” 

<sup>21</sup> Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh. 

<sup>22</sup> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.” Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”
