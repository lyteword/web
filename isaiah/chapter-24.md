# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.

<sup>2</sup> It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.

<sup>3</sup> The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.

<sup>4</sup> The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.

<sup>5</sup> The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.

<sup>7</sup> The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.

<sup>8</sup> The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.

<sup>9</sup> They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.

<sup>10</sup> The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

<sup>11</sup> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.

<sup>12</sup> The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.

<sup>13</sup> For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.

<sup>14</sup> These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.

<sup>15</sup> Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!

<sup>16</sup> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.

<sup>17</sup> Fear, the pit, and the snare are on you who inhabit the earth.

<sup>18</sup> It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.

<sup>19</sup> The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.

<sup>20</sup> The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.

<sup>21</sup> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.

<sup>22</sup> They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.

<sup>23</sup> Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.
