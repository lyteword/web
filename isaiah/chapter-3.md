# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support, the whole supply of bread, and the whole supply of water; 

<sup>2</sup> the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet, the diviner, the elder, 

<sup>3</sup> the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor, the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter. 

<sup>4</sup> I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall rule over them. 

<sup>5</sup> The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone by his neighbor. The child will behave himself proudly against the old man, and the wicked against the honorable. 

<sup>6</sup> Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, “You have clothing, you be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand.” 

<sup>7</sup> In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me ruler of the people.” 

<sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes of his glory. 

<sup>9</sup> The look of their faces testify against them. They parade their sin like Sodom. They don’t hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought disaster upon themselves. 

<sup>10</sup> Tell the righteous that it will be well with them, for they will eat the fruit of their deeds. 

<sup>11</sup> Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them, for the deeds of their hands will be paid back to them. 

<sup>12</sup> As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths. 

<sup>13</sup> Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples. 

<sup>14</sup> Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and their leaders: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses. 

<sup>15</sup> What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. 

<sup>16</sup> Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant, and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, walking daintily as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet; 

<sup>17</sup> therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion, and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.” 

<sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces, 

<sup>19</sup> the earrings, the bracelets, the veils, 

<sup>20</sup> the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms, 

<sup>21</sup> the signet rings, the nose rings, 

<sup>22</sup> the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses, 

<sup>23</sup> the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls. 

<sup>24</sup> It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty. 

<sup>25</sup> Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war. 

<sup>26</sup> Her gates shall lament and mourn. She shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
