# Chapter 64

<sup>1</sup> Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence— 

<sup>2</sup> as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the water to boil. Make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence! 

<sup>3</sup> When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for, you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence. 

<sup>4</sup> For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him. 

<sup>5</sup> You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time. Shall we be saved? 

<sup>6</sup> For we have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 

<sup>7</sup> There is no one who calls on your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> But now, Yahweh, you are our Father. We are the clay and you our potter. We all are the work of your hand. 

<sup>9</sup> Don’t be furious, Yahweh. Don’t remember iniquity forever. Look and see, we beg you, we are all your people. 

<sup>10</sup> Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 

<sup>11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you is burned with fire. All our pleasant places are laid waste. 

<sup>12</sup> Will you hold yourself back for these things, Yahweh? Will you keep silent and punish us very severely?
