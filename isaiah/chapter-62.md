# Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> For Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning lamp. 

<sup>2</sup> The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name, which Yahweh’s mouth will name. 

<sup>3</sup> You will also be a crown of beauty in Yahweh’s hand, and a royal diadem in your God’s hand. 

<sup>4</sup> You will not be called Forsaken any more, nor will your land be called Desolate any more; but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your land will be married. 

<sup>5</sup> For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you. As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you. 

<sup>6</sup> I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem. They will never be silent day nor night. You who call on Yahweh, take no rest, 

<sup>7</sup> and give him no rest until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, “Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies, and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored, 

<sup>9</sup> but those who have harvested it will eat it, and praise Yahweh. Those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.” 

<sup>10</sup> Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Build up, build up the highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your salvation comes! Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him!’” 

<sup>12</sup> They will call them “The Holy People, Yahweh’s Redeemed”. You will be called “Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken”.
