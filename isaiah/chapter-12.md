# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.

<sup>2</sup> Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.”

<sup>3</sup> Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.

<sup>4</sup> In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Declare his doings among the peoples! Proclaim that his name is exalted!

<sup>5</sup> Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!

<sup>6</sup> Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is great among you!”
