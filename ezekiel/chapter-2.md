# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”

<sup>2</sup> The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.

<sup>3</sup> He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.

<sup>4</sup> The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord[^537] Yahweh says.’

<sup>5</sup> They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know that there has been a prophet among them.

<sup>6</sup> You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

<sup>7</sup> You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious.

<sup>8</sup> But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.”

<sup>9</sup> When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.

<sup>10</sup> He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it.

[^537]: 2:4 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
