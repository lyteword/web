# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Oh that you were like my brother, who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would kiss you; yes, and no one would despise me. 

<sup>2</sup> I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother, who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. 

<sup>3</sup> His left hand would be under my head. His right hand would embrace me. 

<sup>4</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. 

<sup>5</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Beloved Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother conceived you. There she was in labor and bore you. 

<sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yah. 

<sup>7</sup> Many waters canâ€™t quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned. 

<sup>8</sup> We have a little sister. She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for? 

<sup>9</sup> If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. 

<sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. 

<sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. 

<sup>12</sup> My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for you, Solomon, two hundred for those who tend its fruit. 

<sup>13</sup> You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice! 

<sup>14</sup> Come away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!
