# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 

<sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 

<sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste. 

<sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love. 

<sup>5</sup> Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love. 

<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me. 

<sup>7</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. 

<sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills. 

<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young deer. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice. 

<sup>10</sup> My beloved spoke, and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away. 

<sup>11</sup> For behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone. 

<sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 

<sup>13</sup> The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom. They give out their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.” 

<sup>14</sup> My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountainside, let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. 

<sup>15</sup> Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that plunder the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom. 

<sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies. 

<sup>17</sup> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.
