# Chapter 5

**¹** But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.

**²** For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.

**³** For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape.

**⁴** But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.

**⁵** You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,

**⁶** so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.

**⁷** For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.

**⁸** But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

**⁹** For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

**¹⁰** who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

**¹¹** Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.

**¹²** But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

**¹³** and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

**¹⁴** We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.

**¹⁵** See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.

**¹⁶** Always rejoice.

**¹⁷** Pray without ceasing.

**¹⁸** In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.

**¹⁹** Don’t quench the Spirit.

**²⁰** Don’t despise prophecies.

**²¹** Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.

**²²** Abstain from every form of evil.

**²³** May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**²⁴** He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.

**²⁵** Brothers, pray for us.

**²⁶** Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

**²⁷** I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.

**²⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
