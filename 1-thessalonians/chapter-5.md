# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.

<sup>2</sup> For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.

<sup>3</sup> For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape.

<sup>4</sup> But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.

<sup>5</sup> You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,

<sup>6</sup> so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.

<sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.

<sup>8</sup> But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

<sup>9</sup> For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>10</sup> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

<sup>11</sup> Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.

<sup>12</sup> But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

<sup>13</sup> and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

<sup>14</sup> We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.

<sup>15</sup> See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.

<sup>16</sup> Always rejoice.

<sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing.

<sup>18</sup> In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.

<sup>19</sup> Don’t quench the Spirit.

<sup>20</sup> Don’t despise prophecies.

<sup>21</sup> Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.

<sup>22</sup> Abstain from every form of evil.

<sup>23</sup> May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>24</sup> He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.

<sup>25</sup> Brothers, pray for us.

<sup>26</sup> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

<sup>27</sup> I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.

<sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
