# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.” 

<sup>2</sup> Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

<sup>3</sup> As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground. 

<sup>4</sup> Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering, 

<sup>5</sup> but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? 

<sup>7</sup> If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” 

<sup>8</sup> Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground. 

<sup>11</sup> Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 

<sup>12</sup> From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” 

<sup>13</sup> Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.” 

<sup>15</sup> Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him. 

<sup>16</sup> Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 

<sup>17</sup> Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 

<sup>18</sup> Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. 

<sup>19</sup> Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. 

<sup>20</sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 

<sup>21</sup> His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. 

<sup>22</sup> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah. 

<sup>23</sup> Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me. 

<sup>24</sup> If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.” 

<sup>25</sup> Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.” 

<sup>26</sup> A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.
