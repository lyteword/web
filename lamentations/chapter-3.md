# Chapter 3

**¹** I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

**²** He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.

**³** Surely he turns his hand against me again and again all day long.

**⁴** He has made my flesh and my skin old. He has broken my bones.

**⁵** He has built against me, and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.

**⁶** He has made me dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead.

**⁷** He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out. He has made my chain heavy.

**⁸** Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.

**⁹** He has walled up my ways with cut stone. He has made my paths crooked.

**¹⁰** He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in hiding.

**¹¹** He has turned away my path, and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate.

**¹²** He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

**¹³** He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.

**¹⁴** I have become a derision to all my people, and their song all day long.

**¹⁵** He has filled me with bitterness. He has stuffed me with wormwood.

**¹⁶** He has also broken my teeth with gravel. He has covered me with ashes.

**¹⁷** You have removed my soul far away from peace. I forgot prosperity.

**¹⁸** I said, “My strength has perished, along with my expectation from Yahweh.”

**¹⁹** Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the bitterness.

**²⁰** My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.

**²¹** This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope.

**²²** It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his mercies don’t fail.

**²³** They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness.

**²⁴** “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul. “Therefore I will hope in him.”

**²⁵** Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.

**²⁶** It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.

**²⁷** It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

**²⁸** Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him.

**²⁹** Let him put his mouth in the dust, if it is so that there may be hope.

**³⁰** Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. Let him be filled full of reproach.

**³¹** For the Lord will not cast off forever.

**³²** For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.

**³³** For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.

**³⁴** To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,

**³⁵** to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,

**³⁶** to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.

**³⁷** Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn’t command it?

**³⁸** Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?

**³⁹** Why should a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

**⁴⁰** Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.

**⁴¹** Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God[^532] in the heavens.

**⁴²** “We have transgressed and have rebelled. You have not pardoned.

**⁴³** “You have covered us with anger and pursued us. You have killed. You have not pitied.

**⁴⁴** You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.

**⁴⁵** You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the middle of the peoples.

**⁴⁶** “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.

**⁴⁷** Terror and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction.”

**⁴⁸** My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

**⁴⁹** My eye pours down and doesn’t cease, without any intermission,

**⁵⁰** until Yahweh looks down, and sees from heaven.

**⁵¹** My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.

**⁵²** They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.

**⁵³** They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.

**⁵⁴** Waters flowed over my head. I said, “I am cut off.”

**⁵⁵** I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.

**⁵⁶** You heard my voice: “Don’t hide your ear from my sighing, and my cry.”

**⁵⁷** You came near in the day that I called on you. You said, “Don’t be afraid.”

**⁵⁸** Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life.

**⁵⁹** Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause.

**⁶⁰** You have seen all their vengeance and all their plans against me.

**⁶¹** You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their plans against me,

**⁶²** the lips of those that rose up against me, and their plots against me all day long.

**⁶³** You see their sitting down and their rising up. I am their song.

**⁶⁴** You will pay them back, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.

**⁶⁵** You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.

**⁶⁶** You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
