# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely he turns his hand against me again and again all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> He has made my flesh and my skin old. He has broken my bones. 

<sup>5</sup> He has built against me, and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. 

<sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead. 

<sup>7</sup> He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out. He has made my chain heavy. 

<sup>8</sup> Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer. 

<sup>9</sup> He has walled up my ways with cut stone. He has made my paths crooked. 

<sup>10</sup> He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in hiding. 

<sup>11</sup> He has turned away my path, and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate. 

<sup>12</sup> He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

<sup>13</sup> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. 

<sup>14</sup> I have become a derision to all my people, and their song all day long. 

<sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness. He has stuffed me with wormwood. 

<sup>16</sup> He has also broken my teeth with gravel. He has covered me with ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> You have removed my soul far away from peace. I forgot prosperity. 

<sup>18</sup> I said, “My strength has perished, along with my expectation from Yahweh.” 

<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the bitterness. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me. 

<sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope. 

<sup>22</sup> It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his mercies don’t fail. 

<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness. 

<sup>24</sup> “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul. “Therefore I will hope in him.” 

<sup>25</sup> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. 

<sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. 

<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him. 

<sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if it is so that there may be hope. 

<sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. Let him be filled full of reproach. 

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off forever. 

<sup>32</sup> For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. 

<sup>33</sup> For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. 

<sup>34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, 

<sup>35</sup> to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 

<sup>36</sup> to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve. 

<sup>37</sup> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn’t command it? 

<sup>38</sup> Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? 

<sup>39</sup> Why should a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 

<sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh. 

<sup>41</sup> Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens. 

<sup>42</sup> “We have transgressed and have rebelled. You have not pardoned. 

<sup>43</sup> “You have covered us with anger and pursued us. You have killed. You have not pitied. 

<sup>44</sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. 

<sup>45</sup> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the middle of the peoples. 

<sup>46</sup> “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 

<sup>47</sup> Terror and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction.” 

<sup>48</sup> My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> My eye pours down and doesn’t cease, without any intermission, 

<sup>50</sup> until Yahweh looks down, and sees from heaven. 

<sup>51</sup> My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. 

<sup>52</sup> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause. 

<sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me. 

<sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head. I said, “I am cut off.” 

<sup>55</sup> I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon. 

<sup>56</sup> You heard my voice: “Don’t hide your ear from my sighing, and my cry.” 

<sup>57</sup> You came near in the day that I called on you. You said, “Don’t be afraid.” 

<sup>58</sup> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life. 

<sup>59</sup> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause. 

<sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance and all their plans against me. 

<sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their plans against me, 

<sup>62</sup> the lips of those that rose up against me, and their plots against me all day long. 

<sup>63</sup> You see their sitting down and their rising up. I am their song. 

<sup>64</sup> You will pay them back, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them. 

<sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
