# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us. Look, and see our reproach. 

<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to aliens. 

<sup>3</sup> We are orphans and fatherless. Our mothers are as widows. 

<sup>4</sup> We must pay for water to drink. Our wood is sold to us. 

<sup>5</sup> Our pursuers are on our necks. We are weary, and have no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> We have given our hands to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned, and are no more. We have borne their iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> Servants rule over us. There is no one to deliver us out of their hand. 

<sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven, because of the burning heat of famine. 

<sup>11</sup> They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> Princes were hanged up by their hands. The faces of elders were not honored. 

<sup>13</sup> The young men carry millstones. The children stumbled under loads of wood. 

<sup>14</sup> The elders have ceased from the gate, and the young men from their music. 

<sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart has ceased. Our dance is turned into mourning. 

<sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

<sup>17</sup> For this our heart is faint. For these things our eyes are dim: 

<sup>18</sup> for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. The foxes walk on it. 

<sup>19</sup> You, Yahweh, remain forever. Your throne is from generation to generation. 

<sup>20</sup> Why do you forget us forever, and forsake us for so long a time? 

<sup>21</sup> Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned. Renew our days as of old. 

<sup>22</sup> But you have utterly rejected us. You are very angry against us.
