# Lamentations 5 

**¹** Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us. Look, and see our reproach.

**²** Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to aliens.

**³** We are orphans and fatherless. Our mothers are as widows.

**⁴** We must pay for water to drink. Our wood is sold to us.

**⁵** Our pursuers are on our necks. We are weary, and have no rest.

**⁶** We have given our hands to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

**⁷** Our fathers sinned, and are no more. We have borne their iniquities.

**⁸** Servants rule over us. There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.

**⁹** We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness.

**¹⁰** Our skin is black like an oven, because of the burning heat of famine.

**¹¹** They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah.

**¹²** Princes were hanged up by their hands. The faces of elders were not honored.

**¹³** The young men carry millstones. The children stumbled under loads of wood.

**¹⁴** The elders have ceased from the gate, and the young men from their music.

**¹⁵** The joy of our heart has ceased. Our dance is turned into mourning.

**¹⁶** The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!

**¹⁷** For this our heart is faint. For these things our eyes are dim:

**¹⁸** for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. The foxes walk on it.

**¹⁹** You, Yahweh, remain forever. Your throne is from generation to generation.

**²⁰** Why do you forget us forever, and forsake us for so long a time?

**²¹** Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned. Renew our days as of old.

**²²** But you have utterly rejected us. You are very angry against us.
