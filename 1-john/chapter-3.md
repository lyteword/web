# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him. 

<sup>2</sup> Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is. 

<sup>3</sup> Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure. 

<sup>4</sup> Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. 

<sup>5</sup> You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him. 

<sup>6</sup> Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him. 

<sup>7</sup> Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 

<sup>8</sup> He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil. 

<sup>9</sup> Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he can’t sin, because he is born of God. 

<sup>10</sup> In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother. 

<sup>11</sup> For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another— 

<sup>12</sup> unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s righteous. 

<sup>13</sup> Don’t be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you. 

<sup>14</sup> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn’t love his brother remains in death. 

<sup>15</sup> Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 

<sup>16</sup> By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 

<sup>17</sup> But whoever has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, then closes his heart of compassion against him, how does God’s love remain in him? 

<sup>18</sup> My little children, let’s not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. 

<sup>19</sup> And by this we know that we are of the truth and persuade our hearts before him, 

<sup>20</sup> because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 

<sup>21</sup> Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God; 

<sup>22</sup> so whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. 

<sup>23</sup> This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded. 

<sup>24</sup> He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
