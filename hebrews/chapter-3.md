# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,

<sup>2</sup> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.

<sup>3</sup> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.

<sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.

<sup>5</sup> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,

<sup>6</sup> but Christ[^1310] is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.

<sup>7</sup> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you will hear his voice,

<sup>8</sup> don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of the trial in the wilderness,

<sup>9</sup> where your fathers tested me and tried me, and saw my deeds for forty years.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, ‘They always err in their heart, but they didn’t know my ways.’

<sup>11</sup> As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”[^1311]

<sup>12</sup> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;

<sup>13</sup> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

<sup>14</sup> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,

<sup>15</sup> while it is said, “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”[^1312]

<sup>16</sup> For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?

<sup>17</sup> With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?

<sup>18</sup> To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?

<sup>19</sup> We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.
