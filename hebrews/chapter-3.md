# Chapter 3

**¹** Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,

**²** who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.

**³** For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.

**⁴** For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.

**⁵** Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,

**⁶** but Christ[^1310] is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.

**⁷** Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you will hear his voice,

**⁸** don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of the trial in the wilderness,

**⁹** where your fathers tested me and tried me, and saw my deeds for forty years.

**¹⁰** Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, ‘They always err in their heart, but they didn’t know my ways.’

**¹¹** As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’”[^1311]

**¹²** Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;

**¹³** but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

**¹⁴** For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,

**¹⁵** while it is said, “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”[^1312]

**¹⁶** For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?

**¹⁷** With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?

**¹⁸** To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?

**¹⁹** We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.
