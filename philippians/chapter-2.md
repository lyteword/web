# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> If therefore there is any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, 

<sup>2</sup> make my joy full by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 

<sup>3</sup> doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself; 

<sup>4</sup> each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. 

<sup>5</sup> Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, 

<sup>7</sup> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. 

<sup>8</sup> And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death of the cross. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name, 

<sup>10</sup> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth, 

<sup>11</sup> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

<sup>12</sup> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 

<sup>13</sup> For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 

<sup>14</sup> Do all things without complaining and arguing, 

<sup>15</sup> that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world, 

<sup>16</sup> holding up the word of life, that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run in vain nor labor in vain. 

<sup>17</sup> Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 

<sup>18</sup> In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me. 

<sup>19</sup> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing. 

<sup>20</sup> For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you. 

<sup>21</sup> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>22</sup> But you know that he has proved himself. As a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News. 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me. 

<sup>24</sup> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly. 

<sup>25</sup> But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need, 

<sup>26</sup> since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick. 

<sup>27</sup> For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow. 

<sup>28</sup> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 

<sup>29</sup> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such people in honor, 

<sup>30</sup> because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
