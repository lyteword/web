# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ,[^1259] to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers[^1260] and servants:[^1261]

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>3</sup> I thank my God whenever I remember you,

<sup>4</sup> always in every request of mine on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy,

<sup>5</sup> for your partnership[^1262] in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;

<sup>6</sup> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.

<sup>7</sup> It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.

<sup>8</sup> For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.

<sup>9</sup> This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment,

<sup>10</sup> so that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ,

<sup>11</sup> being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

<sup>12</sup> Now I desire to have you know, brothers,[^1263] that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News,

<sup>13</sup> so that it became evident to the whole palace[^1264] guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ,

<sup>14</sup> and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.

<sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.

<sup>16</sup> The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;

<sup>17</sup> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.

<sup>18</sup> What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.

<sup>19</sup> For I know that this will turn out to my salvation through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

<sup>20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.

<sup>21</sup> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

<sup>22</sup> But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose.

<sup>23</sup> But I am hard pressed between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.

<sup>24</sup> Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.

<sup>25</sup> Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,

<sup>26</sup> that your boasting[^1265] may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.

<sup>27</sup> Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;

<sup>28</sup> and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.

<sup>29</sup> Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,

<sup>30</sup> having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
