# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh said to Moses,

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘I am Yahweh your God.

<sup>3</sup> You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived. You shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You shall not follow their statutes.

<sup>4</sup> You shall do my ordinances. You shall keep my statutes and walk in them. I am Yahweh your God.

<sup>5</sup> You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I am Yahweh.

<sup>6</sup> “‘None of you shall approach any close relatives, to uncover their nakedness: I am Yahweh.

<sup>7</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, nor the nakedness of your mother: she is your mother. You shall not uncover her nakedness.

<sup>8</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife. It is your father’s nakedness.

<sup>9</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born abroad.

<sup>10</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness; for theirs is your own nakedness.

<sup>11</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, conceived by your father, since she is your sister.

<sup>12</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister. She is your father’s near kinswoman.

<sup>13</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s near kinswoman.

<sup>14</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother. You shall not approach his wife. She is your aunt.

<sup>15</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife. You shall not uncover her nakedness.

<sup>16</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife. It is your brother’s nakedness.

<sup>17</sup> “‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are near kinswomen. It is wickedness.

<sup>18</sup> “‘You shall not take a wife in addition to her sister, to be a rival, to uncover her nakedness, while her sister is still alive.

<sup>19</sup> “‘You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.

<sup>20</sup> “‘You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife, and defile yourself with her.

<sup>21</sup> “‘You shall not give any of your children as a sacrifice to Molech. You shall not profane the name of your God. I am Yahweh.

<sup>22</sup> “‘You shall not lie with a man as with a woman. That is detestable.

<sup>23</sup> “‘You shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it. No woman may give herself to an animal, to lie down with it: it is a perversion.

<sup>24</sup> “‘Don’t defile yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations which I am casting out before you were defiled.

<sup>25</sup> The land was defiled. Therefore I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out her inhabitants.

<sup>26</sup> You therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the native-born, nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you

<sup>27</sup> (for the men of the land that were before you had done all these abominations, and the land became defiled),

<sup>28</sup> that the land not vomit you out also, when you defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.

<sup>29</sup> “‘For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.

<sup>30</sup> Therefore you shall keep my requirements, that you do not practice any of these abominable customs which were practiced before you, and that you do not defile yourselves with them. I am Yahweh your God.’”
