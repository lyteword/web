# Chapter 19

**¹** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**²** “Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘You shall be holy; for I, Yahweh your God, am holy.

**³** “‘Each one of you shall respect his mother and his father. You shall keep my Sabbaths. I am Yahweh your God.

**⁴** “‘Don’t turn to idols, nor make molten gods for yourselves. I am Yahweh your God.

**⁵** “‘When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted.

**⁶** It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day. If anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned with fire.

**⁷** If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination. It will not be accepted;

**⁸** but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Yahweh, and that soul shall be cut off from his people.

**⁹** “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.

**¹⁰** You shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.

**¹¹** “‘You shall not steal. “‘You shall not lie. “‘You shall not deceive one another.

**¹²** “‘You shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of your God. I am Yahweh.

**¹³** “‘You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him. “‘The wages of a hired servant shall not remain with you all night until the morning.

**¹⁴** “‘You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind; but you shall fear your God. I am Yahweh.

**¹⁵** “‘You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor show favoritism to the great; but you shall judge your neighbor in righteousness.

**¹⁶** “‘You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people. “‘You shall not endanger the life[^117] of your neighbor. I am Yahweh.

**¹⁷** “‘You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.

**¹⁸** “‘You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people; but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am Yahweh.

**¹⁹** “‘You shall keep my statutes. “‘You shall not cross-breed different kinds of animals. “‘You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed; “‘Don’t wear a garment made of two kinds of material.

**²⁰** “‘If a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave girl, pledged to be married to another man, and not ransomed or given her freedom; they shall be punished. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

**²¹** He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, even a ram for a trespass offering.

**²²** The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has committed; and the sin which he has committed shall be forgiven him.

**²³** “‘When you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as forbidden.[^118] For three years it shall be forbidden to you. It shall not be eaten.

**²⁴** But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, for giving praise to Yahweh.

**²⁵** In the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, that it may yield its increase to you. I am Yahweh your God.

**²⁶** “‘You shall not eat any meat with the blood still in it. You shall not use enchantments, nor practice sorcery.

**²⁷** “‘You shall not cut the hair on the sides of your head or clip off the edge of your beard.

**²⁸** “‘You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on you. I am Yahweh.

**²⁹** “‘Don’t profane your daughter, to make her a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.

**³⁰** “‘You shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Yahweh.

**³¹** “‘Don’t turn to those who are mediums, nor to the wizards. Don’t seek them out, to be defiled by them. I am Yahweh your God.

**³²** “‘You shall rise up before the gray head and honor the face of the elderly; and you shall fear your God. I am Yahweh.

**³³** “‘If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.

**³⁴** The stranger who lives as a foreigner with you shall be to you as the native-born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you lived as foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.

**³⁵** “‘You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.

**³⁶** You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah,[^119] and a just hin.[^120] I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

**³⁷** “‘You shall observe all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them. I am Yahweh.’”
