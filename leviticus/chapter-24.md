# Leviticus 24 

**¹** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**²** “Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.

**³** Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.

**⁴** He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh continually.

**⁵** “You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an ephah[^129] shall be in one cake.

**⁶** You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh.

**⁷** You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

**⁸** Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel.

**⁹** It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.”

**¹⁰** The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.

**¹¹** The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

**¹²** They put him in custody until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them.

**¹³** Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

**¹⁴** “Bring him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

**¹⁵** You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.

**¹⁶** He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name.

**¹⁷** “‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.

**¹⁸** He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.

**¹⁹** If anyone injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done:

**²⁰** fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. It shall be done to him as he has injured someone.

**²¹** He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.

**²²** You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your God.’”

**²³** Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
