# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> “Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 

<sup>3</sup> Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh continually. 

<sup>5</sup> “You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an ephah shall be in one cake. 

<sup>6</sup> You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh. 

<sup>7</sup> You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 

<sup>8</sup> Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.” 

<sup>10</sup> The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. 

<sup>11</sup> The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 

<sup>12</sup> They put him in custody until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them. 

<sup>13</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

<sup>14</sup> “Bring him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 

<sup>15</sup> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. 

<sup>16</sup> He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name. 

<sup>17</sup> “‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death. 

<sup>18</sup> He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life. 

<sup>19</sup> If anyone injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done: 

<sup>20</sup> fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. It shall be done to him as he has injured someone. 

<sup>21</sup> He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death. 

<sup>22</sup> You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your God.’” 

<sup>23</sup> Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
