# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: 

<sup>2</sup> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. 

<sup>3</sup> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, 

<sup>4</sup> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. 

<sup>5</sup> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. 

<sup>6</sup> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. 

<sup>7</sup> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. 

<sup>8</sup> From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 

<sup>9</sup> Be diligent to come to me soon, 

<sup>10</sup> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. 

<sup>11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 

<sup>12</sup> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 

<sup>13</sup> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you comeâ€”and the books, especially the parchments. 

<sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 

<sup>15</sup> Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words. 

<sup>16</sup> At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. 

<sup>17</sup> But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 

<sup>18</sup> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>19</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 

<sup>20</sup> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. 

<sup>21</sup> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
