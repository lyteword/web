# Chapter 4

**¹** I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:

**²** preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching.

**³** For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,

**⁴** and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.

**⁵** But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.

**⁶** For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.

**⁷** I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.

**⁸** From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

**⁹** Be diligent to come to me soon,

**¹⁰** for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.

**¹¹** Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.

**¹²** But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

**¹³** Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments.

**¹⁴** Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.

**¹⁵** Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.

**¹⁶** At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.

**¹⁷** But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

**¹⁸** And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

**¹⁹** Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.

**²⁰** Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.

**²¹** Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.

**²²** The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
