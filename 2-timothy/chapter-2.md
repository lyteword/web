# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>2</sup> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 

<sup>3</sup> You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>4</sup> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. 

<sup>5</sup> Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. 

<sup>6</sup> The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. 

<sup>7</sup> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News, 

<sup>9</sup> in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

<sup>11</sup> This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him. 

<sup>12</sup> If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. 

<sup>13</sup> If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.” 

<sup>14</sup> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 

<sup>15</sup> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. 

<sup>16</sup> But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, 

<sup>17</sup> and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: 

<sup>18</sup> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. 

<sup>19</sup> However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.” 

<sup>20</sup> Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. 

<sup>21</sup> If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. 

<sup>22</sup> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

<sup>23</sup> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. 

<sup>24</sup> The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, 

<sup>25</sup> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, 

<sup>26</sup> and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
