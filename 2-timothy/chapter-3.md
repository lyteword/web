# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. 

<sup>2</sup> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

<sup>3</sup> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, 

<sup>4</sup> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 

<sup>5</sup> holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. 

<sup>6</sup> For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 

<sup>7</sup> always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>8</sup> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. 

<sup>9</sup> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 

<sup>10</sup> But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 

<sup>11</sup> persecutions, and sufferingsâ€”those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. 

<sup>12</sup> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 

<sup>13</sup> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

<sup>14</sup> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. 

<sup>15</sup> From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>16</sup> Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, 

<sup>17</sup> that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
