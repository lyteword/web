# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ[^1289] through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,

<sup>2</sup> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

<sup>3</sup> I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day

<sup>4</sup> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;

<sup>5</sup> having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.

<sup>6</sup> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

<sup>7</sup> For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,

<sup>9</sup> who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,

<sup>10</sup> but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.

<sup>11</sup> For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

<sup>12</sup> For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.

<sup>13</sup> Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

<sup>14</sup> That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

<sup>15</sup> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

<sup>16</sup> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,

<sup>17</sup> but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me

<sup>18</sup> (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

[^1289]: 1:1 “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
