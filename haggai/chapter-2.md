# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing? 

<sup>4</sup> Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies. 

<sup>5</sup> This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’ 

<sup>6</sup> For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once more, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land; 

<sup>7</sup> and I will shake all nations. The treasure of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies. 

<sup>8</sup> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies. 

<sup>9</sup> ‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.” 

<sup>10</sup> In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, Yahweh’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 

<sup>11</sup> “Yahweh of Armies says: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, 

<sup>12</sup> ‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’” The priests answered, “No.” 

<sup>13</sup> Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?” The priests answered, “It will be unclean.” 

<sup>14</sup> Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean. 

<sup>15</sup> Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in Yahweh’s temple. 

<sup>16</sup> Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty. 

<sup>17</sup> I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh. 

<sup>18</sup> ‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it. 

<sup>19</sup> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From today I will bless you.’” 

<sup>20</sup> Yahweh’s word came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, 

<sup>21</sup> “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth. 

<sup>22</sup> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother. 

<sup>23</sup> In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, I will take you, Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”
