# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David. Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly; Yahweh will hear when I call to him. 

<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh. 

<sup>6</sup> Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us. 

<sup>7</sup> You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 

<sup>8</sup> In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety.
