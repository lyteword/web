# Psalm 4 

For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

**²** You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? \qs Selah.\qs*

**³** But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly; Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

**⁴** Stand in awe, and don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.

**⁶** Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.

**⁷** You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.

**⁸** In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety.
