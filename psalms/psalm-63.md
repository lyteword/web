# Psalm 63

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah. God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. 

<sup>2</sup> So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory. 

<sup>3</sup> Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you. 

<sup>4</sup> So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name. 

<sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, 

<sup>6</sup> when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches. 

<sup>7</sup> For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. 

<sup>8</sup> My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up. 

<sup>9</sup> But those who seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food. 

<sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
