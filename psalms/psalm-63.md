# Psalm 63 

A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah.

**¹** God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.

**²** So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory.

**³** Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you.

**⁴** So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.

**⁵** My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,

**⁶** when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches.

**⁷** For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.

**⁸** My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up.

**⁹** But those who seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

**¹⁰** They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food.

**¹¹** But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
