# Psalm 8

For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens!

<sup>2</sup> From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.

<sup>3</sup> When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,

<sup>4</sup> what is man, that you think of him? What is the son of man, that you care for him?

<sup>5</sup> For you have made him a little lower than the angels,[^426] and crowned him with glory and honor.

<sup>6</sup> You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:

<sup>7</sup> All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals of the field,

<sup>8</sup> the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

[^426]: 8:5 Hebrew: Elohim. The word Elohim, used here, usually means “God”, but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”. The Septuagint reads “angels” here. See also the quote from the Septuagint in Hebrews 2:7.
