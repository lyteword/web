# Psalm 8

For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens!

**²** From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.

**³** When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,

**⁴** what is man, that you think of him? What is the son of man, that you care for him?

**⁵** For you have made him a little lower than the angels,[^426] and crowned him with glory and honor.

**⁶** You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:

**⁷** All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals of the field,

**⁸** the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

**⁹** Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

[^426]: 8:5 Hebrew: Elohim. The word Elohim, used here, usually means “God”, but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”. The Septuagint reads “angels” here. See also the quote from the Septuagint in Hebrews 2:7.
