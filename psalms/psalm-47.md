# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. Oh clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to God with the voice of triumph! 

<sup>2</sup> For Yahweh Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet. 

<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet. 

<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God! Sing praises! Sing praises to our King! Sing praises! 

<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne. 

<sup>9</sup> The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted!
