**³** He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.

**⁴** He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.

**⁶** Sing praises to God! Sing praises! Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!

**⁷** For God is the King of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding.

**⁸** God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne.

**⁹** The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted!
