# Psalm 77

For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.

<sup>1</sup> My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.

<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>4</sup> You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can’t speak.

<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

<sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:

<sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?

<sup>8</sup> Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?

<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>10</sup> Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High.”

<sup>11</sup> I will remember Yah’s deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.

<sup>12</sup> I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.

<sup>13</sup> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?

<sup>14</sup> You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.

<sup>15</sup> You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.

<sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.

<sup>19</sup> Your way was through the sea, your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.

<sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
