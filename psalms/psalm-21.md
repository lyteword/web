# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. The king rejoices in your strength, Yahweh! How greatly he rejoices in your salvation! 

<sup>2</sup> You have given him his heartâ€™s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness. You set a crown of fine gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> He asked life of you and you gave it to him, even length of days forever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation. You lay honor and majesty on him. 

<sup>6</sup> For you make him most blessed forever. You make him glad with joy in your presence. 

<sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in Yahweh. Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you. 

<sup>9</sup> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire shall devour them. 

<sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against you. They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed. 

<sup>12</sup> For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn bows at their face. 

<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and praise your power.
