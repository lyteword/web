# Psalm 21 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** The king rejoices in your strength, Yahweh! How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!

**²** You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. *Selah.*

**³** For you meet him with the blessings of goodness. You set a crown of fine gold on his head.

**⁴** He asked life of you and you gave it to him, even length of days forever and ever.

**⁵** His glory is great in your salvation. You lay honor and majesty on him.

**⁶** For you make him most blessed forever. You make him glad with joy in your presence.

**⁷** For the king trusts in Yahweh. Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.

**⁸** Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you.

**⁹** You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire shall devour them.

**¹⁰** You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from among the children of men.

**¹¹** For they intended evil against you. They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.

**¹²** For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn bows at their face.

**¹³** Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and praise your power.
