# Psalm 58

For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A poem by David.

<sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?

<sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you plot injustice. You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.

<sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb. They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake, like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,

<sup>5</sup> which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful the charmer may be.

<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.

<sup>7</sup> Let them vanish like water that flows away. When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.

<sup>8</sup> Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.

<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,

<sup>11</sup> so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”
