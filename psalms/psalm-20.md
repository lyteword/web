# Psalm 20

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high, 

<sup>2</sup> send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion, 

<sup>3</sup> remember all your offerings, and accept your burned sacrifice. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> May he grant you your heartâ€™s desire, and fulfill all your counsel. 

<sup>5</sup> We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your requests. 

<sup>6</sup> Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God. 

<sup>8</sup> They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright. 

<sup>9</sup> Save, Yahweh! Let the King answer us when we call!
