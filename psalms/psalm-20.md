# Psalm 20 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,

**²** send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion,

**³** remember all your offerings, and accept your burned sacrifice. *Selah.*

**⁴** May he grant you your heart’s desire, and fulfill all your counsel.

**⁵** We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your requests.

**⁶** Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand.

**⁷** Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God.

**⁸** They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.

**⁹** Save, Yahweh! Let the King answer us when we call!
