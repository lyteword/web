# Psalm 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless Yahweh, my soul. Yahweh, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.

<sup>2</sup> He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.

<sup>3</sup> He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind.

<sup>4</sup> He makes his messengers[^454] winds, and his servants flames of fire.

<sup>5</sup> He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.

<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.

<sup>7</sup> At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.

<sup>8</sup> The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them.

<sup>9</sup> You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.

<sup>10</sup> He sends springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

<sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches.

<sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.

<sup>14</sup> He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may produce food out of the earth:

<sup>15</sup> wine that makes the heart of man glad, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man’s heart.

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,

<sup>17</sup> where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.

<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.

<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.

<sup>20</sup> You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.

<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.

<sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away, and lie down in their dens.

<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work, to his labor until the evening.

<sup>24</sup> Yahweh, how many are your works! In wisdom, you have made them all. The earth is full of your riches.

<sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.

<sup>26</sup> There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.

<sup>27</sup> These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season.

<sup>28</sup> You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.

<sup>29</sup> You hide your face; they are troubled. You take away their breath; they die and return to the dust.

<sup>30</sup> You send out your Spirit and they are created. You renew the face of the ground.

<sup>31</sup> Let Yahweh’s glory endure forever. Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.

<sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.

<sup>33</sup> I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in Yahweh.

<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless Yahweh, my soul. Praise Yah!
