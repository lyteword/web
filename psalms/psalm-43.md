# Psalm 43

<sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.

<sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

<sup>3</sup> Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill, to your tents.

<sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.

<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him: my Savior, my helper, and my God.
