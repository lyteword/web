# Psalm 33

<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous! Praise is fitting for the upright.

<sup>2</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre. Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.

<sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a shout of joy!

<sup>4</sup> For Yahweh’s word is right. All his work is done in faithfulness.

<sup>5</sup> He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh.

<sup>6</sup> By Yahweh’s word, the heavens were made: all their army by the breath of his mouth.

<sup>7</sup> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the deeps in storehouses.

<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it was done. He commanded, and it stood firm.

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing. He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.

<sup>11</sup> The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.

<sup>13</sup> Yahweh looks from heaven. He sees all the sons of men.

<sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,

<sup>15</sup> he who fashions all of their hearts; and he considers all of their works.

<sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of an army. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.

<sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does he deliver any by his great power.

<sup>18</sup> Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his loving kindness,

<sup>19</sup> to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.

<sup>20</sup> Our soul has waited for Yahweh. He is our help and our shield.

<sup>21</sup> For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.

<sup>22</sup> Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, since we have hoped in you.
