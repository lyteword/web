# Psalm 33 

**¹** Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous! Praise is fitting for the upright.

**²** Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre. Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.

**³** Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a shout of joy!

**⁴** For Yahweh’s word is right. All his work is done in faithfulness.

**⁵** He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh.

**⁶** By Yahweh’s word, the heavens were made: all their army by the breath of his mouth.

**⁷** He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the deeps in storehouses.

**⁸** Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

**⁹** For he spoke, and it was done. He commanded, and it stood firm.

**¹⁰** Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing. He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.

**¹¹** The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

**¹²** Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.

**¹³** Yahweh looks from heaven. He sees all the sons of men.

**¹⁴** From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,

**¹⁵** he who fashions all of their hearts; and he considers all of their works.

**¹⁶** There is no king saved by the multitude of an army. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.

**¹⁷** A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does he deliver any by his great power.

**¹⁸** Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his loving kindness,

**¹⁹** to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.

**²⁰** Our soul has waited for Yahweh. He is our help and our shield.

**²¹** For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.

**²²** Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, since we have hoped in you.
