# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. For a stringed instrument. By David. Hear my cry, God. Listen to my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

<sup>3</sup> For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy. 

<sup>4</sup> I will dwell in your tent forever. I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> For you, God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 

<sup>6</sup> You will prolong the king’s life. His years will be for generations. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever. Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him. 

<sup>8</sup> So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.
