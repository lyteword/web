# Psalm 61 

For the Chief Musician. For a stringed instrument. By David.

**¹** Hear my cry, God. Listen to my prayer.

**²** From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

**³** For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.

**⁴** I will dwell in your tent forever. I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** For you, God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

**⁶** You will prolong the king’s life. His years will be for generations.

**⁷** He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever. Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.

**⁸** So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.
