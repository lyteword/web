# Psalm 147

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh builds up Jerusalem. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. 

<sup>4</sup> He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names. 

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh upholds the humble. He brings the wicked down to the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving. Sing praises on the harp to our God, 

<sup>8</sup> who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains. 

<sup>9</sup> He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens when they call. 

<sup>10</sup> He doesn’t delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his loving kindness. 

<sup>12</sup> Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem! Praise your God, Zion! 

<sup>13</sup> For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you. 

<sup>14</sup> He makes peace in your borders. He fills you with the finest of the wheat. 

<sup>15</sup> He sends out his commandment to the earth. His word runs very swiftly. 

<sup>16</sup> He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can stand before his cold? 

<sup>18</sup> He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

<sup>19</sup> He shows his word to Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances to Israel. 

<sup>20</sup> He has not done this for just any nation. They don’t know his ordinances. Praise Yah!
