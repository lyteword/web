# Psalm 147

**¹** Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.

**²** Yahweh builds up Jerusalem. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.

**³** He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.

**⁴** He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names.

**⁵** Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite.

**⁶** Yahweh upholds the humble. He brings the wicked down to the ground.

**⁷** Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving. Sing praises on the harp to our God,

**⁸** who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains.

**⁹** He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens when they call.

**¹⁰** He doesn’t delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

**¹¹** Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his loving kindness.

**¹²** Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem! Praise your God, Zion!

**¹³** For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you.

**¹⁴** He makes peace in your borders. He fills you with the finest of the wheat.

**¹⁵** He sends out his commandment to the earth. His word runs very swiftly.

**¹⁶** He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.

**¹⁷** He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can stand before his cold?

**¹⁸** He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

**¹⁹** He shows his word to Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.

**²⁰** He has not done this for just any nation. They don’t know his ordinances. Praise Yah!
