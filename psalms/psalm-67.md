# Psalm 67 

For the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.

**¹** May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause his face to shine on us. \qs Selah.\qs*

**²** That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation among all nations,

**³** let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.

**⁴** Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** Let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.

**⁶** The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us.

**⁷** God will bless us. All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
