# Psalm 67

For the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.

<sup>1</sup> May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause his face to shine on us. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>2</sup> That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation among all nations,

<sup>3</sup> let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.

<sup>4</sup> Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>5</sup> Let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.

<sup>6</sup> The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us.

<sup>7</sup> God will bless us. All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
