# Psalm 79

A Psalm by Asaph.

**¹** God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

**²** They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.

**³** They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.

**⁴** We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.

**⁵** How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?

**⁶** Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,

**⁷** for they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.

**⁸** Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.

**⁹** Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.

**¹⁰** Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.

**¹¹** Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.

**¹²** Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.

**¹³** So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.
