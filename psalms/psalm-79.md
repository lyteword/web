# Psalm 79

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by Asaph. God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. 

<sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them. 

<sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us. 

<sup>5</sup> How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 

<sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name, 

<sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland. 

<sup>8</sup> Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need. 

<sup>9</sup> Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake. 

<sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death. 

<sup>12</sup> Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.
