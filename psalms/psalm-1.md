# Psalm 1

**¹** Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;

**²** but his delight is in Yahweh’s[^419] law. On his law he meditates day and night.

**³** He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.

**⁴** The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.

**⁵** Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

**⁶** For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

[^419]: 1:2 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
