# Psalm 1

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers; 

<sup>2</sup> but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. On his law he meditates day and night. 

<sup>3</sup> He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper. 

<sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.
