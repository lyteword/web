# Psalm 114 

**¹** When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language,

**²** Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.

**³** The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.

**⁴** The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.

**⁵** What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back?

**⁶** You mountains, that you skipped like rams? You little hills, like lambs?

**⁷** Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

**⁸** who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
