# Psalm 114

<sup>1</sup> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language,

<sup>2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.

<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.

<sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.

<sup>5</sup> What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back?

<sup>6</sup> You mountains, that you skipped like rams? You little hills, like lambs?

<sup>7</sup> Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

<sup>8</sup> who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
