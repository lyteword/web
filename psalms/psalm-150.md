<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise God in his sanctuary! Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power!

<sup>3</sup> Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet! Praise him with harp and lyre!

<sup>4</sup> Praise him with tambourine and dancing! Praise him with stringed instruments and flute!

<sup>5</sup> Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise him with resounding cymbals!

<sup>6</sup> Let everything that has breath praise Yah! Praise Yah!
