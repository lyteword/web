# Psalm 66

For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.

**¹** Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!

**²** Sing to the glory of his name! Offer glory and praise!

**³** Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.

**⁴** All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you; they will sing to your name.” \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** Come, and see God’s deeds— awesome work on behalf of the children of men.

**⁶** He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him.

**⁷** He rules by his might forever. His eyes watch the nations. Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁸** Praise our God, you peoples! Make the sound of his praise heard,

**⁹** who preserves our life among the living, and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.

**¹⁰** For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as silver is refined.

**¹¹** You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our backs.

**¹²** You allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance.

**¹³** I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to you,

**¹⁴** which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.

**¹⁵** I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. \qs Selah.\qs*

**¹⁶** Come and hear, all you who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul.

**¹⁷** I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue.

**¹⁸** If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord wouldn’t have listened.

**¹⁹** But most certainly, God has listened. He has heard the voice of my prayer.

**²⁰** Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.
