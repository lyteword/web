# Psalm 66

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm. Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth! 

<sup>2</sup> Sing to the glory of his name! Offer glory and praise! 

<sup>3</sup> Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you. 

<sup>4</sup> All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you; they will sing to your name.” Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Come, and see God’s deeds— awesome work on behalf of the children of men. 

<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him. 

<sup>7</sup> He rules by his might forever. His eyes watch the nations. Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> Praise our God, you peoples! Make the sound of his praise heard, 

<sup>9</sup> who preserves our life among the living, and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved. 

<sup>10</sup> For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as silver is refined. 

<sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our backs. 

<sup>12</sup> You allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance. 

<sup>13</sup> I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to you, 

<sup>14</sup> which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress. 

<sup>15</sup> I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah. 

<sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul. 

<sup>17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue. 

<sup>18</sup> If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord wouldn’t have listened. 

<sup>19</sup> But most certainly, God has listened. He has heard the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.
