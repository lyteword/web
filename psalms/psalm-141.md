# Psalm 141

A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh, I have called on you. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you.

**²** Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.

**³** Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.

**⁴** Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.

**⁵** Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; don’t let my head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.

**⁶** Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.

**⁷** “As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”[^464]

**⁸** For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. I take refuge in you. Don’t leave my soul destitute.

**⁹** Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

**¹⁰** Let the wicked fall together into their own nets while I pass by.

[^464]: 141:7 Sheol is the place of the dead.
