# Psalm 141

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. Yahweh, I have called on you. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice. 

<sup>3</sup> Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips. 

<sup>4</sup> Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. Don’t let me eat of their delicacies. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; don’t let my head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds. 

<sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will hear my words, for they are well spoken. 

<sup>7</sup> “As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.” 

<sup>8</sup> For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. I take refuge in you. Don’t leave my soul destitute. 

<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, from the traps of the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall together into their own nets while I pass by.
