# Psalm 3

A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.

<sup>2</sup> Many there are who say of my soul, “There is no help for him in God.”[^423] \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>3</sup> But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.

<sup>4</sup> I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>5</sup> I laid myself down and slept. I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me.

<sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.

<sup>7</sup> Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.

<sup>8</sup> Salvation belongs to Yahweh. May your blessing be on your people. \qs Selah.\qs*

[^423]: 3:2 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
