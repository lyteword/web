# Psalm 3

A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

**¹** Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.

**²** Many there are who say of my soul, “There is no help for him in God.”[^423] \qs Selah.\qs*

**³** But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.

**⁴** I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** I laid myself down and slept. I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me.

**⁶** I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.

**⁷** Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.

**⁸** Salvation belongs to Yahweh. May your blessing be on your people. \qs Selah.\qs*

[^423]: 3:2 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
