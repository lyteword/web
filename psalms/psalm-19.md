# Psalm 19 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** The heavens declare the glory of God. The expanse shows his handiwork.

**²** Day after day they pour out speech, and night after night they display knowledge.

**³** There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard.

**⁴** Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,

**⁵** which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room, like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.

**⁶** His going out is from the end of the heavens, his circuit to its ends. There is nothing hidden from its heat.

**⁷** Yahweh’s law is perfect, restoring the soul. Yahweh’s covenant is sure, making wise the simple.

**⁸** Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.

**⁹** The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.

**¹⁰** They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.

**¹¹** Moreover your servant is warned by them. In keeping them there is great reward.

**¹²** Who can discern his errors? Forgive me from hidden errors.

**¹³** Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.

**¹⁴** Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
