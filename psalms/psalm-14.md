# Psalm 14

For the Chief Musician. By David.

**¹** The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good.

**²** Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God.

**³** They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one.

**⁴** Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on Yahweh?

**⁵** There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.

**⁶** You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.

**⁷** Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
