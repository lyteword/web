# Psalm 38

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David, for a memorial. Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me. 

<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. 

<sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt because of my foolishness. 

<sup>6</sup> I am in pain and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all day long. 

<sup>7</sup> For my waist is filled with burning. There is no soundness in my flesh. 

<sup>8</sup> I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you. My groaning is not hidden from you. 

<sup>10</sup> My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me. 

<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away. 

<sup>12</sup> They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long. 

<sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear. I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs. 

<sup>15</sup> For I hope in you, Yahweh. You will answer, Lord my God. 

<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.” 

<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me. 

<sup>18</sup> For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> But my enemies are vigorous and many. Those who hate me without reason are numerous. 

<sup>20</sup> They who give evil for good are also adversaries to me, because I follow what is good. 

<sup>21</sup> Don’t forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don’t be far from me. 

<sup>22</sup> Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
