**³** His work is honor and majesty. His righteousness endures forever.

**⁴** He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered. Yahweh is gracious and merciful.

**⁵** He has given food to those who fear him. He always remembers his covenant.

**⁶** He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.

**⁷** The works of his hands are truth and justice. All his precepts are sure.

**⁸** They are established forever and ever. They are done in truth and uprightness.

**⁹** He has sent redemption to his people. He has ordained his covenant forever. His name is holy and awesome!
