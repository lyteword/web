# Psalm 111

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah![^458] I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh’s works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them.

<sup>3</sup> His work is honor and majesty. His righteousness endures forever.

<sup>4</sup> He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered. Yahweh is gracious and merciful.

<sup>5</sup> He has given food to those who fear him. He always remembers his covenant.

<sup>6</sup> He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.

<sup>7</sup> The works of his hands are truth and justice. All his precepts are sure.

<sup>8</sup> They are established forever and ever. They are done in truth and uprightness.

<sup>9</sup> He has sent redemption to his people. He has ordained his covenant forever. His name is holy and awesome!

<sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. All those who do his work have a good understanding. His praise endures forever!
