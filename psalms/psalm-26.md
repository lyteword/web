# Psalm 26

<sup>1</sup> By David. Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering. 

<sup>2</sup> Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind. 

<sup>3</sup> For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth. 

<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites. 

<sup>5</sup> I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Yahweh, 

<sup>7</sup> that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard and tell of all your wondrous deeds. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells. 

<sup>9</sup> Donâ€™t gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men 

<sup>10</sup> in whose hands is wickedness; their right hand is full of bribes. 

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me. 

<sup>12</sup> My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
