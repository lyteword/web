# Psalm 26 

By David.

**¹** Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.

**²** Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.

**³** For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth.

**⁴** I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites.

**⁵** I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.

**⁶** I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Yahweh,

**⁷** that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard and tell of all your wondrous deeds.

**⁸** Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells.

**⁹** Don’t gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men

**¹⁰** in whose hands is wickedness; their right hand is full of bribes.

**¹¹** But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.

**¹²** My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
