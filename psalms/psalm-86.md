# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer by David. Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. 

<sup>2</sup> Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you. 

<sup>3</sup> Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. Listen to the voice of my petitions. 

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds like your deeds. 

<sup>9</sup> All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord. They shall glorify your name. 

<sup>10</sup> For you are great, and do wondrous things. You are God alone. 

<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name. 

<sup>12</sup> I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forever more. 

<sup>13</sup> For your loving kindness is great toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol. 

<sup>14</sup> God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they donâ€™t hold regard for you before them. 

<sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth. 

<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give your strength to your servant. Save the son of your servant. 

<sup>17</sup> Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.
