# Psalm 86

A Prayer by David.

**¹** Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.

**²** Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.

**³** Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.

**⁴** Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.

**⁵** For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.

**⁶** Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. Listen to the voice of my petitions.

**⁷** In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me.

**⁸** There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds like your deeds.

**⁹** All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord. They shall glorify your name.

**¹⁰** For you are great, and do wondrous things. You are God alone.

**¹¹** Teach me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name.

**¹²** I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forever more.

**¹³** For your loving kindness is great toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.[^446]

**¹⁴** God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they don’t hold regard for you before them.

**¹⁵** But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.

**¹⁶** Turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give your strength to your servant. Save the son of your servant.

**¹⁷** Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.

[^446]: 86:13 Sheol is the place of the dead.
