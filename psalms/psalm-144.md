# Psalm 144

<sup>1</sup> By David. Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who trains my hands to war, and my fingers to battleâ€” 

<sup>2</sup> my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? Or the son of man, that you think of him? 

<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away. 

<sup>5</sup> Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them. 

<sup>7</sup> Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners, 

<sup>8</sup> whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song to you, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you. 

<sup>10</sup> You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword. 

<sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace. 

<sup>13</sup> Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields. 

<sup>14</sup> Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets. 

<sup>15</sup> Happy are the people who are in such a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.
