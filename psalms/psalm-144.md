# Psalm 144 

By David.

**¹** Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who trains my hands to war, and my fingers to battle—

**²** my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me.

**³** Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? Or the son of man, that you think of him?

**⁴** Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away.

**⁵** Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.

**⁶** Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them.

**⁷** Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners,

**⁸** whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

**⁹** I will sing a new song to you, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.

**¹⁰** You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.

**¹¹** Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

**¹²** Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.

**¹³** Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields.

**¹⁴** Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.

**¹⁵** Happy are the people who are in such a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.
