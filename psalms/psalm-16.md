# Psalm 16

<sup>1</sup> A Poem by David. Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing.” 

<sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight. 

<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips. 

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure. 

<sup>6</sup> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance. 

<sup>7</sup> I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons. 

<sup>8</sup> I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety. 

<sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. 

<sup>11</sup> You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
