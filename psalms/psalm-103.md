# Psalm 103

By David.

**¹** Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is within me, praise his holy name!

**²** Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don’t forget all his benefits,

**³** who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases,

**⁴** who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies,

**⁵** who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

**⁶** Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all who are oppressed.

**⁷** He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.

**⁸** Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.

**⁹** He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.

**¹⁰** He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities.

**¹¹** For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.

**¹²** As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

**¹³** Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.

**¹⁴** For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust.

**¹⁵** As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

**¹⁶** For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.

**¹⁷** But Yahweh’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to children’s children,

**¹⁸** to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to obey his precepts.

**¹⁹** Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all.

**²⁰** Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word.

**²¹** Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his, who do his pleasure.

**²²** Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul!
