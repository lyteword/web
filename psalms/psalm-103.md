# Psalm 103

<sup>1</sup> By David. Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is within me, praise his holy name! 

<sup>2</sup> Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don’t forget all his benefits, 

<sup>3</sup> who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases, 

<sup>4</sup> who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, 

<sup>5</sup> who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all who are oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness. 

<sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever. 

<sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities. 

<sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him. 

<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 

<sup>13</sup> Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him. 

<sup>14</sup> For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust. 

<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. 

<sup>16</sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more. 

<sup>17</sup> But Yahweh’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to children’s children, 

<sup>18</sup> to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to obey his precepts. 

<sup>19</sup> Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all. 

<sup>20</sup> Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word. 

<sup>21</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his, who do his pleasure. 

<sup>22</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul!
