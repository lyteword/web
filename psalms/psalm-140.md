# Psalm 140 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Deliver me, Yahweh, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men:

**²** those who devise mischief in their hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war.

**³** They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Viper’s poison is under their lips. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁴** Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.

**⁵** The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁶** I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.” Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.

**⁷** Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.

**⁸** Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁹** As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

**¹⁰** Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise.

**¹¹** An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

**¹²** I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.

**¹³** Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.
