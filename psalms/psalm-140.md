# Psalm 140

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. Deliver me, Yahweh, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men: 

<sup>2</sup> those who devise mischief in their hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war. 

<sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Viper’s poison is under their lips. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet. 

<sup>5</sup> The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me. Selah. 

<sup>6</sup> I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.” Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh. 

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 

<sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise. 

<sup>11</sup> An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 

<sup>12</sup> I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.
