# Psalm 116

<sup>1</sup> I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy. 

<sup>2</sup> Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 

<sup>3</sup> The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow. 

<sup>4</sup> Then I called on Yahweh’s name: “Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.” 

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh is gracious and righteous. Yes, our God is merciful. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me. 

<sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you. 

<sup>8</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 

<sup>9</sup> I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living. 

<sup>10</sup> I believed, therefore I said, “I was greatly afflicted.” 

<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste, “All people are liars.” 

<sup>12</sup> What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me? 

<sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s name. 

<sup>14</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people. 

<sup>15</sup> Precious in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his saints. 

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your servant girl. You have freed me from my chains. 

<sup>17</sup> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on Yahweh’s name. 

<sup>18</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people, 

<sup>19</sup> in the courts of Yahweh’s house, in the middle of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
