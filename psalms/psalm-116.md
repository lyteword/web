# Psalm 116

**¹** I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy.

**²** Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.

**³** The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol[^460] got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow.

**⁴** Then I called on Yahweh’s name: “Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.”

**⁵** Yahweh is gracious and righteous. Yes, our God is merciful.

**⁶** Yahweh preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me.

**⁷** Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.

**⁸** For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

**⁹** I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.

**¹⁰** I believed, therefore I said, “I was greatly afflicted.”

**¹¹** I said in my haste, “All people are liars.”

**¹²** What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?

**¹³** I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s name.

**¹⁴** I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people.

**¹⁵** Precious in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his saints.

**¹⁶** Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your servant girl. You have freed me from my chains.

**¹⁷** I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on Yahweh’s name.

**¹⁸** I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people,

**¹⁹** in the courts of Yahweh’s house, in the middle of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

[^460]: 116:3 Sheol is the place of the dead.
