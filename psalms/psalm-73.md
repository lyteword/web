# Psalm 73

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped. 

<sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm. 

<sup>5</sup> They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment. 

<sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit. 

<sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression. 

<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance. 

<sup>11</sup> They say, “How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?” 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence, 

<sup>14</sup> For all day long I have been plagued, and punished every morning. 

<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak thus”, behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children. 

<sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me— 

<sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end. 

<sup>18</sup> Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors. 

<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies. 

<sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart. 

<sup>22</sup> I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you. 

<sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. 

<sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you. 

<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 

<sup>27</sup> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you. 

<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
