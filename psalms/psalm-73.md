# Psalm 73

A Psalm by Asaph.

**¹** Surely God[^443] is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.

**²** But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.

**³** For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

**⁴** For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.

**⁵** They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.

**⁶** Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.

**⁷** Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.

**⁸** They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.

**⁹** They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.

**¹⁰** Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.

**¹¹** They say, “How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?”

**¹²** Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.

**¹³** Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence,

**¹⁴** For all day long I have been plagued, and punished every morning.

**¹⁵** If I had said, “I will speak thus”, behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.

**¹⁶** When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me—

**¹⁷** until I entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end.

**¹⁸** Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.

**¹⁹** How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.

**²⁰** As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord,[^444] when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.

**²¹** For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.

**²²** I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.

**²³** Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.

**²⁴** You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

**²⁵** Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.

**²⁶** My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

**²⁷** For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.

**²⁸** But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh[^445] my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.

[^443]: 73:1 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
[^444]: 73:20 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
[^445]: 73:28 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
