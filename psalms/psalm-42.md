# Psalm 42

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? 

<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” 

<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day. 

<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence. 

<sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar. 

<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life. 

<sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” 

<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” 

<sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, the saving help of my countenance, and my God.
