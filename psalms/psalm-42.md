# Psalm 42

For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah.

<sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God.[^435]

<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?

<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”

<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.

<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.

<sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.

<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh[^436] will command his loving kindness in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life.

<sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”

<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”

<sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

[^435]: 42:1 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
[^436]: 42:8 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
