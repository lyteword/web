# Psalm 23 

A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh is my shepherd; I shall lack nothing.

**²** He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.

**³** He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.

**⁴** Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

**⁵** You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.

**⁶** Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
