# Psalm 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. Yahweh is my shepherd; I shall lack nothing. 

<sup>2</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 

<sup>3</sup> He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 

<sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. 

<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
