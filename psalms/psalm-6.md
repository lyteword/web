# Psalm 6 

For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.

**²** Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

**³** My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh—how long?

**⁴** Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.

**⁵** For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol,[^424] who shall give you thanks?

**⁶** I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.

**⁷** My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.

**⁸** Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.

**⁹** Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.

**¹⁰** May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

[^424]: 6:5 Sheol is the place of the dead.
