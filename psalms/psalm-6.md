# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David. Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 

<sup>3</sup> My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh—how long? 

<sup>4</sup> Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. 

<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears. 

<sup>7</sup> My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries. 

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
