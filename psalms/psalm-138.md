# Psalm 138

By David.

**¹** I will give you thanks with my whole heart. Before the gods,[^462] I will sing praises to you.

**²** I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.

**³** In the day that I called, you answered me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul.

**⁴** All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they have heard the words of your mouth.

**⁵** Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, for Yahweh’s glory is great!

**⁶** For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly; but he knows the proud from afar.

**⁷** Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me. You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.

**⁸** Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me. Your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever. Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.

[^462]: 138:1 The word elohim, used here, usually means “God” but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”.
