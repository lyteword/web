# Psalm 51 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

**¹** Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.

**²** Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin.

**³** For I know my transgressions. My sin is constantly before me.

**⁴** Against you, and you only, I have sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight, so you may be proved right when you speak, and justified when you judge.

**⁵** Behold, I was born in iniquity. My mother conceived me in sin.

**⁶** Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.

**⁷** Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

**⁸** Let me hear joy and gladness, that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.

**⁹** Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities.

**¹⁰** Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me.

**¹¹** Don’t throw me from your presence, and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.

**¹²** Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit.

**¹³** Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners will be converted to you.

**¹⁴** Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.

**¹⁵** Lord, open my lips. My mouth will declare your praise.

**¹⁶** For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering.

**¹⁷** The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.

**¹⁸** Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem.

**¹⁹** Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
