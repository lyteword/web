# Psalm 9 

For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm by David.

**¹** I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.

**²** I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.

**³** When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.

**⁴** For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.

**⁵** You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.

**⁶** The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.

**⁷** But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.

**⁸** He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.

**⁹** Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.

**¹⁰** Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.

**¹¹** Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what he has done.

**¹²** For he who avenges blood remembers them. He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.

**¹³** Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death,

**¹⁴** that I may show all of your praise. I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.

**¹⁵** The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.

**¹⁶** Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. \qs Meditation. Selah.\qs*

**¹⁷** The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,[^427] even all the nations that forget God.

**¹⁸** For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.

**¹⁹** Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.

**²⁰** Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only men. \qs Selah.\qs*

[^427]: 9:17 Sheol is the place of the dead.
