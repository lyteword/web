# Psalm 9

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm by David. I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works. 

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence. 

<sup>4</sup> For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously. 

<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished. 

<sup>7</sup> But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble. 

<sup>10</sup> Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you. 

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what he has done. 

<sup>12</sup> For he who avenges blood remembers them. He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>13</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death, 

<sup>14</sup> that I may show all of your praise. I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion. 

<sup>15</sup> The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken. 

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah. 

<sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God. 

<sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever. 

<sup>19</sup> Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight. 

<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah.
