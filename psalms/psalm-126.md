# Psalm 126

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream.

**²** Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, “Yahweh has done great things for them.”

**³** Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.

**⁴** Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.

**⁵** Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.

**⁶** He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
