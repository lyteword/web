# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream. 

<sup>2</sup> Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, “Yahweh has done great things for them.” 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad. 

<sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev. 

<sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. 

<sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
