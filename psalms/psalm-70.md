# Psalm 70 

For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder.

**¹** Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.

**²** Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.

**³** Let them be turned because of their shame who say, “Aha! Aha!”

**⁴** Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, “Let God be exalted!”

**⁵** But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don’t delay.
