# Psalm 70

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder. Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh. 

<sup>2</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned because of their shame who say, “Aha! Aha!” 

<sup>4</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, “Let God be exalted!” 

<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don’t delay.
