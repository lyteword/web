# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph. Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob! 

<sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp. 

<sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 

<sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn’t know. 

<sup>6</sup> “I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket. 

<sup>7</sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah.” Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me! 

<sup>9</sup> There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god. 

<sup>10</sup> I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

<sup>11</sup> But my people didn’t listen to my voice. Israel desired none of me. 

<sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels. 

<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 

<sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 

<sup>15</sup> The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever. 

<sup>16</sup> But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
