# Psalm 81

For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.

**¹** Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!

**²** Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.

**³** Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.

**⁴** For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

**⁵** He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn’t know.

**⁶** “I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.

**⁷** You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah.” \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁸** “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me!

**⁹** There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god.

**¹⁰** I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

**¹¹** But my people didn’t listen to my voice. Israel desired none of me.

**¹²** So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.

**¹³** Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!

**¹⁴** I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.

**¹⁵** The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.

**¹⁶** But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
