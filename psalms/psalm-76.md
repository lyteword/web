# Psalm 76

For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.

<sup>1</sup> In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.

<sup>2</sup> His tabernacle is also in Salem. His dwelling place in Zion.

<sup>3</sup> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>4</sup> Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.

<sup>5</sup> Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.

<sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

<sup>7</sup> You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?

<sup>8</sup> You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,

<sup>9</sup> when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.

<sup>11</sup> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.

<sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.
