# Psalm 76 

For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.

**¹** In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.

**²** His tabernacle is also in Salem. His dwelling place in Zion.

**³** There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. *Selah.*

**⁴** Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.

**⁵** Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.

**⁶** At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

**⁷** You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?

**⁸** You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,

**⁹** when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. *Selah.*

**¹⁰** Surely the wrath of man praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.

**¹¹** Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.

**¹²** He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.
