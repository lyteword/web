# Psalm 83

<sup>1</sup> A song. A Psalm by Asaph. God, don’t keep silent. Don’t keep silent, and don’t be still, God. 

<sup>2</sup> For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads. 

<sup>3</sup> They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones. 

<sup>4</sup> “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” 

<sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you. 

<sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites; 

<sup>7</sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 

<sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; 

<sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

<sup>12</sup> who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.” 

<sup>13</sup> My God, make them like tumbleweed, like chaff before the wind. 

<sup>14</sup> As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire, 

<sup>15</sup> so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm. 

<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh. 

<sup>17</sup> Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish; 

<sup>18</sup> that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.
