# Psalm 145

A praise psalm by David.[^465]

<sup>1</sup> I will exalt you, my God, the King. I will praise your name forever and ever.

<sup>2</sup> Every day I will praise you. I will extol your name forever and ever.

<sup>3</sup> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised! His greatness is unsearchable.

<sup>4</sup> One generation will commend your works to another, and will declare your mighty acts.

<sup>5</sup> I will meditate on the glorious majesty of your honor, on your wondrous works.

<sup>6</sup> Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts. I will declare your greatness.

<sup>7</sup> They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving kindness.

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh is good to all. His tender mercies are over all his works.

<sup>10</sup> All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh. Your saints will extol you.

<sup>11</sup> They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk about your power,

<sup>12</sup> to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.

<sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. Your dominion endures throughout all generations. Yahweh is faithful in all his words, and loving in all his deeds.[^466]

<sup>14</sup> Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of all wait for you. You give them their food in due season.

<sup>16</sup> You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

<sup>17</sup> Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.

<sup>18</sup> Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.

<sup>19</sup> He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him. He also will hear their cry, and will save them.

<sup>20</sup> Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but he will destroy all the wicked.

<sup>21</sup> My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh. Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
