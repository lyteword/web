# Psalm 34

<sup>1</sup> By David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless Yahweh at all times. His praise will always be in my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul shall boast in Yahweh. The humble shall hear of it and be glad. 

<sup>3</sup> Oh magnify Yahweh with me. Let’s exalt his name together. 

<sup>4</sup> I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 

<sup>5</sup> They looked to him, and were radiant. Their faces shall never be covered with shame. 

<sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s angel encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 

<sup>8</sup> Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack with those who fear him. 

<sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, you children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. 

<sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good? 

<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking lies. 

<sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it. 

<sup>15</sup> Yahweh’s eyes are toward the righteous. His ears listen to their cry. 

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s face is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles. 

<sup>18</sup> Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all. 

<sup>20</sup> He protects all of his bones. Not one of them is broken. 

<sup>21</sup> Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned. 

<sup>22</sup> Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
