# Psalm 34 

By David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.

**¹** [^434]I will bless Yahweh at all times. His praise will always be in my mouth.

**²** My soul shall boast in Yahweh. The humble shall hear of it and be glad.

**³** Oh magnify Yahweh with me. Let’s exalt his name together.

**⁴** I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.

**⁵** They looked to him, and were radiant. Their faces shall never be covered with shame.

**⁶** This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

**⁷** Yahweh’s angel encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.

**⁸** Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.

**⁹** Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack with those who fear him.

**¹⁰** The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.

**¹¹** Come, you children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.

**¹²** Who is someone who desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?

**¹³** Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking lies.

**¹⁴** Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it.

**¹⁵** Yahweh’s eyes are toward the righteous. His ears listen to their cry.

**¹⁶** Yahweh’s face is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth.

**¹⁷** The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.

**¹⁸** Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.

**¹⁹** Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.

**²⁰** He protects all of his bones. Not one of them is broken.

**²¹** Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.

**²²** Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
