# Psalm 99

**¹** Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.

**²** Yahweh is great in Zion. He is high above all the peoples.

**³** Let them praise your great and awesome name. He is Holy!

**⁴** The King’s strength also loves justice. You establish equity. You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.

**⁵** Exalt Yahweh our God. Worship at his footstool. He is Holy!

**⁶** Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who call on his name. They called on Yahweh, and he answered them.

**⁷** He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them.

**⁸** You answered them, Yahweh our God. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings.

**⁹** Exalt Yahweh, our God. Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh, our God, is holy!
