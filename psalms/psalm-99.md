# Psalm 99

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh is great in Zion. He is high above all the peoples. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise your great and awesome name. He is Holy! 

<sup>4</sup> The Kingâ€™s strength also loves justice. You establish equity. You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Exalt Yahweh our God. Worship at his footstool. He is Holy! 

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who call on his name. They called on Yahweh, and he answered them. 

<sup>7</sup> He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> You answered them, Yahweh our God. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings. 

<sup>9</sup> Exalt Yahweh, our God. Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh, our God, is holy!
