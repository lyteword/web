# Psalm 88 

A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Suffering of Affliction.” A contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite.

**¹** Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you.

**²** Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry.

**³** For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol.[^448]

**⁴** I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help,

**⁵** set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand.

**⁶** You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.

**⁷** Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁸** You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can’t escape.

**⁹** My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you.

**¹⁰** Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you? \qs Selah.\qs*

**¹¹** Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?

**¹²** Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

**¹³** But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you.

**¹⁴** Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me?

**¹⁵** I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.

**¹⁶** Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.

**¹⁷** They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.

**¹⁸** You have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.

[^448]: 88:3 Sheol is the place of the dead.
