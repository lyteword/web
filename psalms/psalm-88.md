# Psalm 88

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Suffering of Affliction.” A contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite. Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry. 

<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol. 

<sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help, 

<sup>5</sup> set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand. 

<sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths. 

<sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can’t escape. 

<sup>9</sup> My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you. 

<sup>10</sup> Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you? Selah. 

<sup>11</sup> Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction? 

<sup>12</sup> Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

<sup>13</sup> But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you. 

<sup>14</sup> Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me? 

<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted. 

<sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off. 

<sup>17</sup> They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me. 

<sup>18</sup> You have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.
