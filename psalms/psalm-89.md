# Psalm 89

<sup>1</sup> A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite. I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them.” 

<sup>3</sup> “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David, my servant, 

<sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your offspring forever, and build up your throne to all generations.’” Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh, your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. 

<sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh, 

<sup>7</sup> a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around him? 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you. 

<sup>9</sup> You rule the pride of the sea. When its waves rise up, you calm them. 

<sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm. 

<sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours, the world and its fullness. You have founded them. 

<sup>12</sup> You have created the north and the south. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name. 

<sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm. Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted. 

<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your face. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh. 

<sup>16</sup> In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted. 

<sup>17</sup> For you are the glory of their strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted. 

<sup>18</sup> For our shield belongs to Yahweh, our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>19</sup> Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, “I have given strength to the warrior. I have exalted a young man from the people. 

<sup>20</sup> I have found David, my servant. I have anointed him with my holy oil, 

<sup>21</sup> with whom my hand shall be established. My arm will also strengthen him. 

<sup>22</sup> No enemy will tax him. No wicked man will oppress him. 

<sup>23</sup> I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike those who hate him. 

<sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him. In my name, his horn will be exalted. 

<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers. 

<sup>26</sup> He will call to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation!’ 

<sup>27</sup> I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 

<sup>28</sup> I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more. My covenant will stand firm with him. 

<sup>29</sup> I will also make his offspring endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 

<sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law, and don’t walk in my ordinances; 

<sup>31</sup> if they break my statutes, and don’t keep my commandments; 

<sup>32</sup> then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 

<sup>33</sup> But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail. 

<sup>34</sup> I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered. 

<sup>35</sup> Once I have sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David. 

<sup>36</sup> His offspring will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me. 

<sup>37</sup> It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.” Selah. 

<sup>38</sup> But you have rejected and spurned. You have been angry with your anointed. 

<sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant of your servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust. 

<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges. You have brought his strongholds to ruin. 

<sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors. 

<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice. 

<sup>43</sup> Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven’t supported him in battle. 

<sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down to the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth. You have covered him with shame. Selah. 

<sup>46</sup> How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire? 

<sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is, for what vanity you have created all the children of men! 

<sup>48</sup> What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah. 

<sup>49</sup> Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore to David in your faithfulness? 

<sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples, 

<sup>51</sup> With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one. 

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be Yahweh forever more. Amen, and Amen.
