# Psalm 78 

A contemplation by Asaph.

**¹** Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.

**²** I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,

**³** which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

**⁴** We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.

**⁵** For he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;

**⁶** that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,

**⁷** that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments,

**⁸** and might not be as their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

**⁹** The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

**¹⁰** They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and refused to walk in his law.

**¹¹** They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.

**¹²** He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

**¹³** He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.

**¹⁴** In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.

**¹⁵** He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

**¹⁶** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

**¹⁷** Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.

**¹⁸** They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.

**¹⁹** Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

**²⁰** Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?”

**²¹** Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,

**²²** because they didn’t believe in God, and didn’t trust in his salvation.

**²³** Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.

**²⁴** He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.

**²⁵** Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.

**²⁶** He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.

**²⁷** He also rained meat on them as the dust, winged birds as the sand of the seas.

**²⁸** He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.

**²⁹** So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.

**³⁰** They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,

**³¹** when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their strongest, and struck down the young men of Israel.

**³²** For all this they still sinned, and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.

**³³** Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.

**³⁴** When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.

**³⁵** They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.

**³⁶** But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.

**³⁷** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.

**³⁸** But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath.

**³⁹** He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.

**⁴⁰** How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!

**⁴¹** They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

**⁴²** They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;

**⁴³** how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,

**⁴⁴** he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.

**⁴⁵** He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

**⁴⁶** He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.

**⁴⁷** He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.

**⁴⁸** He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

**⁴⁹** He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.

**⁵⁰** He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,

**⁵¹** and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.

**⁵²** But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

**⁵³** He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

**⁵⁴** He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.

**⁵⁵** He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

**⁵⁶** Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies,

**⁵⁷** but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow.

**⁵⁸** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.

**⁵⁹** When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel,

**⁶⁰** so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,

**⁶¹** and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.

**⁶²** He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.

**⁶³** Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.

**⁶⁴** Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep.

**⁶⁵** Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.

**⁶⁶** He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.

**⁶⁷** Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,

**⁶⁸** But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.

**⁶⁹** He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.

**⁷⁰** He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;

**⁷¹** from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.

**⁷²** So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
