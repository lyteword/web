# Psalm 78

<sup>1</sup> A contemplation by Asaph. Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old, 

<sup>3</sup> which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 

<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done. 

<sup>5</sup> For he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; 

<sup>6</sup> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children, 

<sup>7</sup> that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments, 

<sup>8</sup> and might not be as their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God. 

<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 

<sup>10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and refused to walk in his law. 

<sup>11</sup> They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them. 

<sup>12</sup> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

<sup>13</sup> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap. 

<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire. 

<sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. 

<sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 

<sup>17</sup> Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert. 

<sup>18</sup> They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire. 

<sup>19</sup> Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 

<sup>20</sup> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?” 

<sup>21</sup> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel, 

<sup>22</sup> because they didn’t believe in God, and didn’t trust in his salvation. 

<sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven. 

<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky. 

<sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full. 

<sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind. 

<sup>27</sup> He also rained meat on them as the dust, winged birds as the sand of the seas. 

<sup>28</sup> He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations. 

<sup>29</sup> So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire. 

<sup>30</sup> They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths, 

<sup>31</sup> when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their strongest, and struck down the young men of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> For all this they still sinned, and didn’t believe in his wondrous works. 

<sup>33</sup> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror. 

<sup>34</sup> When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly. 

<sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer. 

<sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 

<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant. 

<sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath. 

<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. 

<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert! 

<sup>41</sup> They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>42</sup> They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; 

<sup>43</sup> how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan, 

<sup>44</sup> he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink. 

<sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 

<sup>46</sup> He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. 

<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost. 

<sup>48</sup> He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

<sup>49</sup> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil. 

<sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence, 

<sup>51</sup> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. 

<sup>52</sup> But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

<sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

<sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. 

<sup>55</sup> He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

<sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies, 

<sup>57</sup> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow. 

<sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. 

<sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel, 

<sup>60</sup> so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men, 

<sup>61</sup> and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand. 

<sup>62</sup> He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance. 

<sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song. 

<sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep. 

<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. 

<sup>66</sup> He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach. 

<sup>67</sup> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim, 

<sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved. 

<sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever. 

<sup>70</sup> He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds; 

<sup>71</sup> from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance. 

<sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
