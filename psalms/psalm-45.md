# Psalm 45

For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” A contemplation by the sons of Korah. A wedding song.

<sup>1</sup> My heart overflows with a noble theme. I recite my verses for the king. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.

<sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of the sons of men. Grace has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.

<sup>3</sup> Strap your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and your majesty.

<sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. Let your right hand display awesome deeds.

<sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp. The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.

<sup>6</sup> Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.

<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.

<sup>8</sup> All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.

<sup>9</sup> Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women. At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.

<sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear. Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.

<sup>11</sup> So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.

<sup>12</sup> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift. The rich among the people entreat your favor.

<sup>13</sup> The princess inside is all glorious. Her clothing is interwoven with gold.

<sup>14</sup> She shall be led to the king in embroidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.

<sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king’s palace.

<sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers. You shall make them princes in all the earth.

<sup>17</sup> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
