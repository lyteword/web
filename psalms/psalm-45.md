# Psalm 45

For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” A contemplation by the sons of Korah. A wedding song.

**¹** My heart overflows with a noble theme. I recite my verses for the king. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.

**²** You are the most excellent of the sons of men. Grace has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.

**³** Strap your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and your majesty.

**⁴** In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. Let your right hand display awesome deeds.

**⁵** Your arrows are sharp. The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.

**⁶** Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.

**⁷** You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.

**⁸** All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.

**⁹** Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women. At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.

**¹⁰** Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear. Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.

**¹¹** So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.

**¹²** The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift. The rich among the people entreat your favor.

**¹³** The princess inside is all glorious. Her clothing is interwoven with gold.

**¹⁴** She shall be led to the king in embroidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.

**¹⁵** With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king’s palace.

**¹⁶** Your sons will take the place of your fathers. You shall make them princes in all the earth.

**¹⁷** I will make your name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
