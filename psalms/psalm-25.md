# Psalm 25

By David.

<sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, I lift up my soul.

<sup>2</sup> My God, I have trusted in you. Don’t let me be shamed. Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.

<sup>3</sup> Yes, no one who waits for you will be shamed. They will be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.

<sup>4</sup> Show me your ways, Yahweh. Teach me your paths.

<sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth, and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation. I wait for you all day long.

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness, for they are from old times.

<sup>7</sup> Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. Remember me according to your loving kindness, for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh.

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.

<sup>9</sup> He will guide the humble in justice. He will teach the humble his way.

<sup>10</sup> All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

<sup>11</sup> For your name’s sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.

<sup>12</sup> What man is he who fears Yahweh? He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.

<sup>13</sup> His soul will dwell at ease. His offspring will inherit the land.

<sup>14</sup> The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him. He will show them his covenant.

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.

<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.

<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh bring me out of my distresses.

<sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and my travail. Forgive all my sins.

<sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many. They hate me with cruel hatred.

<sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.

<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.

<sup>22</sup> God, redeem Israel out of all his troubles.
