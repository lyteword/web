# Psalm 25 

By David.

**¹** To you, Yahweh, I lift up my soul.

**²** My God, I have trusted in you. Don’t let me be shamed. Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.

**³** Yes, no one who waits for you will be shamed. They will be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.

**⁴** Show me your ways, Yahweh. Teach me your paths.

**⁵** Guide me in your truth, and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation. I wait for you all day long.

**⁶** Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness, for they are from old times.

**⁷** Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. Remember me according to your loving kindness, for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh.

**⁸** Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.

**⁹** He will guide the humble in justice. He will teach the humble his way.

**¹⁰** All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

**¹¹** For your name’s sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.

**¹²** What man is he who fears Yahweh? He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.

**¹³** His soul will dwell at ease. His offspring will inherit the land.

**¹⁴** The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him. He will show them his covenant.

**¹⁵** My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.

**¹⁶** Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.

**¹⁷** The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh bring me out of my distresses.

**¹⁸** Consider my affliction and my travail. Forgive all my sins.

**¹⁹** Consider my enemies, for they are many. They hate me with cruel hatred.

**²⁰** Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.

**²¹** Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.

**²²** God, redeem Israel out of all his troubles.
