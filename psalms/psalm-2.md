# Psalm 2

**¹** Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?

**²** The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,[^420] saying,

**³** “Let’s break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us.”

**⁴** He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord[^421] will have them in derision.

**⁵** Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:

**⁶** “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”

**⁷** I will tell of the decree: Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. Today I have become your father.

**⁸** Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.

**⁹** You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”

**¹⁰** Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.

**¹¹** Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

**¹²** Give sincere homage to the Son,[^422] lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

[^420]: 2:2 The word “Anointed” is the same as the word for “Messiah” or “Christ”
[^421]: 2:4 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
[^422]: 2:12 or, Kiss the son
