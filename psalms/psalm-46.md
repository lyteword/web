# Psalm 46 

For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth.[^438]

**¹** God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

**²** Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes, though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;

**³** though its waters roar and are troubled, though the mountains tremble with their swelling. *Selah.*

**⁴** There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.

**⁵** God is within her. She shall not be moved. God will help her at dawn.

**⁶** The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. He lifted his voice and the earth melted.

**⁷** Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. *Selah.*

**⁸** Come, see Yahweh’s works, what desolations he has made in the earth.

**⁹** He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. He burns the chariots in the fire.

**¹⁰** “Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.”

**¹¹** Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. *Selah.*
