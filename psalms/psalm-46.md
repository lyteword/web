# Psalm 46

For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth.[^438]

<sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

<sup>2</sup> Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes, though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;

<sup>3</sup> though its waters roar and are troubled, though the mountains tremble with their swelling. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.

<sup>5</sup> God is within her. She shall not be moved. God will help her at dawn.

<sup>6</sup> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. He lifted his voice and the earth melted.

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>8</sup> Come, see Yahweh’s works, what desolations he has made in the earth.

<sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. He burns the chariots in the fire.

<sup>10</sup> “Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.”

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. \qs Selah.\qs*
