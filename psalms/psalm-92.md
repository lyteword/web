# Psalm 92

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High, 

<sup>2</sup> to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night, 

<sup>3</sup> with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody of the lyre. 

<sup>4</sup> For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands. 

<sup>5</sup> How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep. 

<sup>6</sup> A senseless man doesn’t know, neither does a fool understand this: 

<sup>7</sup> though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. 

<sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more. 

<sup>9</sup> For behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered. 

<sup>10</sup> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil. 

<sup>11</sup> My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

<sup>13</sup> They are planted in Yahweh’s house. They will flourish in our God’s courts. 

<sup>14</sup> They will still produce fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green, 

<sup>15</sup> to show that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
