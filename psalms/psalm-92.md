# Psalm 92

A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.

**¹** It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High,

**²** to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,

**³** with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody of the lyre.

**⁴** For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.

**⁵** How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep.

**⁶** A senseless man doesn’t know, neither does a fool understand this:

**⁷** though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.

**⁸** But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more.

**⁹** For behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered.

**¹⁰** But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.

**¹¹** My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.

**¹²** The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

**¹³** They are planted in Yahweh’s house. They will flourish in our God’s courts.

**¹⁴** They will still produce fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green,

**¹⁵** to show that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
