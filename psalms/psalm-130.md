# Psalm 130

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh. 

<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions. 

<sup>3</sup> If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 

<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared. 

<sup>5</sup> I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in his word. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh, for there is loving kindness with Yahweh. Abundant redemption is with him. 

<sup>8</sup> He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
