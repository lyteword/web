# Psalm 130 

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.

**²** Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.

**³** If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?

**⁴** But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.

**⁵** I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in his word.

**⁶** My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning.

**⁷** Israel, hope in Yahweh, for there is loving kindness with Yahweh. Abundant redemption is with him.

**⁸** He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
