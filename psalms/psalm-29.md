# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 

<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Worship Yahweh in holy array. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh’s voice is on the waters. The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh’s voice is powerful. Yahweh’s voice is full of majesty. 

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh’s voice breaks the cedars. Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox. 

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, “Glory!” 

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever. 

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh will give strength to his people. Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
