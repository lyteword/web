# Psalm 29

A Psalm by David.

**¹** Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.

**²** Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Worship Yahweh in holy array.

**³** Yahweh’s voice is on the waters. The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters.

**⁴** Yahweh’s voice is powerful. Yahweh’s voice is full of majesty.

**⁵** Yahweh’s voice breaks the cedars. Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.

**⁶** He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.

**⁷** Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.

**⁸** Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

**⁹** Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, “Glory!”

**¹⁰** Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever.

**¹¹** Yahweh will give strength to his people. Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
