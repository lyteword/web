# Psalm 100

A Psalm of thanksgiving.

**¹** Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!

**²** Serve Yahweh with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.

**³** Know that Yahweh, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

**⁴** Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.

**⁵** For Yahweh is good. His loving kindness endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations.
