# Psalm 15

A Psalm by David.

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?

<sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart;

<sup>3</sup> he who doesn’t slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man;

<sup>4</sup> in whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;

<sup>5</sup> he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
