# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite. Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, 

<sup>2</sup> lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands, 

<sup>4</sup> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, I have plundered him who without cause was my adversary), 

<sup>5</sup> let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah. 

<sup>6</sup> Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God. 

<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day. 

<sup>12</sup> If a man doesnâ€™t repent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow. 

<sup>13</sup> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought out falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made. 

<sup>16</sup> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. 

<sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
