# Psalm 128

A Song of Ascents.

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways.

<sup>2</sup> For you will eat the labor of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.

<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house, your children like olive shoots around your table.

<sup>4</sup> Behold, this is how the man who fears Yahweh is blessed.

<sup>5</sup> May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.

<sup>6</sup> Yes, may you see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
