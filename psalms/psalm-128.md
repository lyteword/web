# Psalm 128 

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways.

**²** For you will eat the labor of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.

**³** Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house, your children like olive shoots around your table.

**⁴** Behold, this is how the man who fears Yahweh is blessed.

**⁵** May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.

**⁶** Yes, may you see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
