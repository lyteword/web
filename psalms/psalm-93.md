# Psalm 93 

**¹** Yahweh reigns! He is clothed with majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established. It can’t be moved.

**²** Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting.

**³** The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves.

**⁴** Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.

**⁵** Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forever more.
