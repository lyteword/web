# Psalm 93

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! He is clothed with majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established. It canâ€™t be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves. 

<sup>4</sup> Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty. 

<sup>5</sup> Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forever more.
