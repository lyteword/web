# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say: 

<sup>2</sup> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. 

<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion. 

<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 

<sup>7</sup> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. 

<sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say, “The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
