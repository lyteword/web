# Psalm 129

A Song of Ascents.

<sup>1</sup> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say:

<sup>2</sup> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.

<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.

<sup>5</sup> Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.

<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up,

<sup>7</sup> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.

<sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say, “The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
