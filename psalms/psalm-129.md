# Psalm 129 

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say:

**²** many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.

**³** The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.

**⁴** Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.

**⁵** Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.

**⁶** Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up,

**⁷** with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.

**⁸** Neither do those who go by say, “The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
