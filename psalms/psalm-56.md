# Psalm 56

For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Silent Dove in Distant Lands.” A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

**¹** Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.

**²** My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.

**³** When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.

**⁴** In God, I praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?

**⁵** All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.

**⁶** They conspire and lurk, watching my steps. They are eager to take my life.

**⁷** Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God.

**⁸** You count my wanderings. You put my tears into your container. Aren’t they in your book?

**⁹** Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this: that God is for me.

**¹⁰** In God, I will praise his word. In Yahweh, I will praise his word.

**¹¹** I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

**¹²** Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you.

**¹³** For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
