# Psalm 56

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Silent Dove in Distant Lands.” A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me. 

<sup>2</sup> My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me. 

<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you. 

<sup>4</sup> In God, I praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? 

<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil. 

<sup>6</sup> They conspire and lurk, watching my steps. They are eager to take my life. 

<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God. 

<sup>8</sup> You count my wanderings. You put my tears into your container. Aren’t they in your book? 

<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this: that God is for me. 

<sup>10</sup> In God, I will praise his word. In Yahweh, I will praise his word. 

<sup>11</sup> I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>12</sup> Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you. 

<sup>13</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
