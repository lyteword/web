# Psalm 71

**¹** In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Never let me be disappointed.

**²** Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me.

**³** Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.

**⁴** Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

**⁵** For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh, my confidence from my youth.

**⁶** I have relied on you from the womb. You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb. I will always praise you.

**⁷** I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.

**⁸** My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor all day long.

**⁹** Don’t reject me in my old age. Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.

**¹⁰** For my enemies talk about me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together,

**¹¹** saying, “God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”

**¹²** God, don’t be far from me. My God, hurry to help me.

**¹³** Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.

**¹⁴** But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.

**¹⁵** My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don’t know its full measure.

**¹⁶** I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.

**¹⁷** God, you have taught me from my youth. Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.

**¹⁸** Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me, until I have declared your strength to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come.

**¹⁹** God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens. You have done great things. God, who is like you?

**²⁰** You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.

**²¹** Increase my honor and comfort me again.

**²²** I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.

**²³** My lips shall shout for joy! My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!

**²⁴** My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want to harm me.
