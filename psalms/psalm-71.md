# Psalm 71

<sup>1</sup> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Never let me be disappointed. 

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me. 

<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. 

<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 

<sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh, my confidence from my youth. 

<sup>6</sup> I have relied on you from the womb. You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb. I will always praise you. 

<sup>7</sup> I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge. 

<sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor all day long. 

<sup>9</sup> Don’t reject me in my old age. Don’t forsake me when my strength fails. 

<sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together, 

<sup>11</sup> saying, “God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.” 

<sup>12</sup> God, don’t be far from me. My God, hurry to help me. 

<sup>13</sup> Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me. 

<sup>14</sup> But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise. 

<sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don’t know its full measure. 

<sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone. 

<sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth. Until now, I have declared your wondrous works. 

<sup>18</sup> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me, until I have declared your strength to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come. 

<sup>19</sup> God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens. You have done great things. God, who is like you? 

<sup>20</sup> You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth. 

<sup>21</sup> Increase my honor and comfort me again. 

<sup>22</sup> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy! My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you! 

<sup>24</sup> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want to harm me.
