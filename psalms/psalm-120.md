# Psalm 120

A Song of Ascents.

<sup>1</sup> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. He answered me.

<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.

<sup>3</sup> What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you, you deceitful tongue?

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

<sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!

<sup>6</sup> My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.

<sup>7</sup> I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
