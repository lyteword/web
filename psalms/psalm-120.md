# Psalm 120

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. He answered me.

**²** Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.

**³** What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you, you deceitful tongue?

**⁴** Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

**⁵** Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!

**⁶** My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.

**⁷** I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
