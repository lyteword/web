# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. By Solomon. Unless Yahweh builds the house, they who build it labor in vain. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late, eating the bread of toil, for he gives sleep to his loved ones. 

<sup>3</sup> Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. The fruit of the womb is his reward. 

<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They wonâ€™t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
