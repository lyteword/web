# Psalm 91

<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

<sup>2</sup> I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.”

<sup>3</sup> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.

<sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.

<sup>5</sup> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,

<sup>6</sup> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.

<sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.

<sup>8</sup> You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked.

<sup>9</sup> Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place,

<sup>10</sup> no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.

<sup>11</sup> For he will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you in all your ways.

<sup>12</sup> They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.

<sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.

<sup>14</sup> “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name.

<sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.

<sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation.”
