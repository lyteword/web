# Psalm 91 

**¹** He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

**²** I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.”

**³** For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.

**⁴** He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.

**⁵** You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,

**⁶** nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.

**⁷** A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.

**⁸** You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked.

**⁹** Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place,

**¹⁰** no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.

**¹¹** For he will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you in all your ways.

**¹²** They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.

**¹³** You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.

**¹⁴** “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name.

**¹⁵** He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.

**¹⁶** I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation.”
