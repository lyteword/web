# Psalm 72

<sup>1</sup> By Solomon. God, give the king your justice; your righteousness to the royal son. 

<sup>2</sup> He will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice. 

<sup>3</sup> The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces. 

<sup>5</sup> They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers that water the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more. 

<sup>8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 

<sup>11</sup> Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him. 

<sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor, who has no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and needy. He will save the souls of the needy. 

<sup>14</sup> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight. 

<sup>15</sup> He will live; and Shebaâ€™s gold will be given to him. Men will pray for him continually. They will bless him all day long. 

<sup>16</sup> Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field. 

<sup>17</sup> His name endures forever. His name continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations will call him blessed. 

<sup>18</sup> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds. 

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be his glorious name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen. 

<sup>20</sup> This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
