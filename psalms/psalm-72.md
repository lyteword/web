# Psalm 72 

By Solomon.

**¹** God, give the king your justice; your righteousness to the royal son.

**²** He will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.

**³** The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.

**⁴** He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.

**⁵** They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.

**⁶** He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.

**⁷** In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.

**⁸** He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.

**⁹** Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust.

**¹⁰** The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

**¹¹** Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. All nations shall serve him.

**¹²** For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor, who has no helper.

**¹³** He will have pity on the poor and needy. He will save the souls of the needy.

**¹⁴** He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight.

**¹⁵** He will live; and Sheba’s gold will be given to him. Men will pray for him continually. They will bless him all day long.

**¹⁶** Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.

**¹⁷** His name endures forever. His name continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations will call him blessed.

**¹⁸** Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.

**¹⁹** Blessed be his glorious name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen.

**²⁰** This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
