# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “Isn’t David hiding himself among us?” Save me, God, by your name. Vindicate me in your might. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, God. Listen to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me. Violent men have sought after my soul. They haven’t set God before them. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is the one who sustains my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> He will repay the evil to my enemies. Destroy them in your truth. 

<sup>6</sup> With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> For he has delivered me out of all trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
