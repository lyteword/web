# Psalm 75

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm by Asaph. A song. We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works. 

<sup>2</sup> When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly. 

<sup>3</sup> The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn. 

<sup>5</sup> Don’t lift up your horn on high. Don’t speak with a stiff neck.” 

<sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation. 

<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another. 

<sup>8</sup> For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>10</sup> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
