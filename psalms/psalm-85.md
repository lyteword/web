# Psalm 85 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.

**¹** Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.

**²** You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sin. \qs Selah.\qs*

**³** You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.

**⁴** Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation toward us to cease.

**⁵** Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?

**⁶** Won’t you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?

**⁷** Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. Grant us your salvation.

**⁸** I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.

**⁹** Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.

**¹⁰** Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

**¹¹** Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven.

**¹²** Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good. Our land will yield its increase.

**¹³** Righteousness goes before him, and prepares the way for his steps.
