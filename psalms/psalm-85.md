# Psalm 85

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sin. Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger. 

<sup>4</sup> Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation toward us to cease. 

<sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations? 

<sup>6</sup> Wonâ€™t you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? 

<sup>7</sup> Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. Grant us your salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn again to folly. 

<sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 

<sup>11</sup> Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good. Our land will yield its increase. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness goes before him, and prepares the way for his steps.
