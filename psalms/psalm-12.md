# Psalm 12 

For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.

**²** Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.

**³** May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,

**⁴** who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”

**⁵** “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says Yahweh; “I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”

**⁶** Yahweh’s words are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.

**⁷** You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever.

**⁸** The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
