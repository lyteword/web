# Psalm 139

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me.

**²** You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar.

**³** You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.

**⁴** For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.

**⁵** You hem me in behind and before. You laid your hand on me.

**⁶** This knowledge is beyond me. It’s lofty. I can’t attain it.

**⁷** Where could I go from your Spirit? Or where could I flee from your presence?

**⁸** If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in Sheol,[^463] behold, you are there!

**⁹** If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,

**¹⁰** even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me.

**¹¹** If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me. The light around me will be night,”

**¹²** even the darkness doesn’t hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you.

**¹³** For you formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother’s womb.

**¹⁴** I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well.

**¹⁵** My frame wasn’t hidden from you, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.

**¹⁶** Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them.

**¹⁷** How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is their sum!

**¹⁸** If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.

**¹⁹** If only you, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!

**²⁰** For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain.

**²¹** Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?

**²²** I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.

**²³** Search me, God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts.

**²⁴** See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.

[^463]: 139:8 Sheol is the place of the dead.
