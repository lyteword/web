# Psalm 139

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me. 

<sup>2</sup> You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar. 

<sup>3</sup> You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether. 

<sup>5</sup> You hem me in behind and before. You laid your hand on me. 

<sup>6</sup> This knowledge is beyond me. It’s lofty. I can’t attain it. 

<sup>7</sup> Where could I go from your Spirit? Or where could I flee from your presence? 

<sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there! 

<sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea, 

<sup>10</sup> even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me. 

<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me. The light around me will be night,” 

<sup>12</sup> even the darkness doesn’t hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you. 

<sup>13</sup> For you formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother’s womb. 

<sup>14</sup> I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well. 

<sup>15</sup> My frame wasn’t hidden from you, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them. 

<sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is their sum! 

<sup>18</sup> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you. 

<sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men! 

<sup>20</sup> For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain. 

<sup>21</sup> Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you? 

<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies. 

<sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts. 

<sup>24</sup> See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.
