# Psalm 131

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. By David. Yahweh, my heart isnâ€™t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

<sup>3</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forward and forever more.
