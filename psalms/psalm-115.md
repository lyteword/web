# Psalm 115

<sup>1</sup> Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth’s sake. 

<sup>2</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God, now?” 

<sup>3</sup> But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases. 

<sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but they don’t speak. They have eyes, but they don’t see. 

<sup>6</sup> They have ears, but they don’t hear. They have noses, but they don’t smell. 

<sup>7</sup> They have hands, but they don’t feel. They have feet, but they don’t walk, neither do they speak through their throat. 

<sup>8</sup> Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them. 

<sup>9</sup> Israel, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>10</sup> House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>11</sup> You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>12</sup> Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron. 

<sup>13</sup> He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great. 

<sup>14</sup> May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>16</sup> The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, but he has given the earth to the children of men. 

<sup>17</sup> The dead don’t praise Yah, nor any who go down into silence, 

<sup>18</sup> but we will bless Yah, from this time forward and forever more. Praise Yah!
