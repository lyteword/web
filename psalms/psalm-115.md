# Psalm 115

**¹** Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth’s sake.

**²** Why should the nations say, “Where is their God, now?”

**³** But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases.

**⁴** Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.

**⁵** They have mouths, but they don’t speak. They have eyes, but they don’t see.

**⁶** They have ears, but they don’t hear. They have noses, but they don’t smell.

**⁷** They have hands, but they don’t feel. They have feet, but they don’t walk, neither do they speak through their throat.

**⁸** Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.

**⁹** Israel, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.

**¹⁰** House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.

**¹¹** You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.

**¹²** Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.

**¹³** He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.

**¹⁴** May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children.

**¹⁵** Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

**¹⁶** The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, but he has given the earth to the children of men.

**¹⁷** The dead don’t praise Yah, nor any who go down into silence,

**¹⁸** but we will bless Yah, from this time forward and forever more. Praise Yah!
