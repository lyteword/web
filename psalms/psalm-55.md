# Psalm 55 

For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David.

**¹** Listen to my prayer, God. Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.

**²** Attend to me, and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and moan

**³** because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring suffering on me. In anger they hold a grudge against me.

**⁴** My heart is severely pained within me. The terrors of death have fallen on me.

**⁵** Fearfulness and trembling have come on me. Horror has overwhelmed me.

**⁶** I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.

**⁷** Behold, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness.” \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁸** “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”

**⁹** Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

**¹⁰** Day and night they prowl around on its walls. Malice and abuse are also within her.

**¹¹** Destructive forces are within her. Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.

**¹²** For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have endured it. Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me, then I would have hidden myself from him.

**¹³** But it was you, a man like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.

**¹⁴** We took sweet fellowship together. We walked in God’s house with company.

**¹⁵** Let death come suddenly on them. Let them go down alive into Sheol.[^442] For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.

**¹⁶** As for me, I will call on God. Yahweh will save me.

**¹⁷** Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress. He will hear my voice.

**¹⁸** He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, although there are many who oppose me.

**¹⁹** God, who is enthroned forever, will hear and answer them. \qs Selah.\qs* They never change and don’t fear God.

**²⁰** He raises his hands against his friends. He has violated his covenant.

**²¹** His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.

**²²** Cast your burden on Yahweh and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved.

**²³** But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.

[^442]: 55:15 Sheol is the place of the dead.
