# Psalm 55

For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David.

<sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, God. Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.

<sup>2</sup> Attend to me, and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and moan

<sup>3</sup> because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring suffering on me. In anger they hold a grudge against me.

<sup>4</sup> My heart is severely pained within me. The terrors of death have fallen on me.

<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling have come on me. Horror has overwhelmed me.

<sup>6</sup> I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.

<sup>7</sup> Behold, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness.” \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>8</sup> “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”

<sup>9</sup> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<sup>10</sup> Day and night they prowl around on its walls. Malice and abuse are also within her.

<sup>11</sup> Destructive forces are within her. Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.

<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have endured it. Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me, then I would have hidden myself from him.

<sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.

<sup>14</sup> We took sweet fellowship together. We walked in God’s house with company.

<sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly on them. Let them go down alive into Sheol.[^442] For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.

<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call on God. Yahweh will save me.

<sup>17</sup> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress. He will hear my voice.

<sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, although there are many who oppose me.

<sup>19</sup> God, who is enthroned forever, will hear and answer them. \qs Selah.\qs* They never change and don’t fear God.

<sup>20</sup> He raises his hands against his friends. He has violated his covenant.

<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.

<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on Yahweh and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved.

<sup>23</sup> But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.

[^442]: 55:15 Sheol is the place of the dead.
