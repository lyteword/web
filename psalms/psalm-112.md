# Psalm 112

**¹** Praise Yah![^459] Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in his commandments.

**²** His offspring will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed.

**³** Wealth and riches are in his house. His righteousness endures forever.

**⁴** Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious, merciful, and righteous.

**⁵** It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He will maintain his cause in judgment.

**⁶** For he will never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever.

**⁷** He will not be afraid of evil news. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh.

**⁸** His heart is established. He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries.

**⁹** He has dispersed, he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted with honor.

**¹⁰** The wicked will see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.

[^459]: 112:1 Psalm 112 is an acrostic poem, with each verse after the initial “Praise Yah!” starting with a letter of the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).
