# Psalm 112

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah![^459] Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in his commandments.

<sup>2</sup> His offspring will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed.

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house. His righteousness endures forever.

<sup>4</sup> Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious, merciful, and righteous.

<sup>5</sup> It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He will maintain his cause in judgment.

<sup>6</sup> For he will never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever.

<sup>7</sup> He will not be afraid of evil news. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh.

<sup>8</sup> His heart is established. He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries.

<sup>9</sup> He has dispersed, he has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted with honor.

<sup>10</sup> The wicked will see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.

[^459]: 112:1 Psalm 112 is an acrostic poem, with each verse after the initial “Praise Yah!” starting with a letter of the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).
