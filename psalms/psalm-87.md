# Psalm 87

A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.

**¹** His foundation is in the holy mountains.

**²** Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

**³** Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. \qs Selah.\qs

**⁴** I will record Rahab[^447] and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.”

**⁵** Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” the Most High himself will establish her.

**⁶** Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁷** Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”

[^447]: 87:4 Rahab is a reference to Egypt.
