# Psalm 87

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.” 

<sup>5</sup> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” the Most High himself will establish her. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah. 

<sup>7</sup> Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”
