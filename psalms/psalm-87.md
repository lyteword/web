# Psalm 87

A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.

<sup>1</sup> His foundation is in the holy mountains.

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. \qs Selah.\qs

<sup>4</sup> I will record Rahab[^447] and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.”

<sup>5</sup> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” the Most High himself will establish her.

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>7</sup> Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”

[^447]: 87:4 Rahab is a reference to Egypt.
