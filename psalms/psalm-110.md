# Psalm 110 

A Psalm by David.

**¹** Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”

**²** Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule among your enemies.

**³** Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.

**⁴** Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”

**⁵** The Lord is at your right hand. He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.

**⁶** He will judge among the nations. He will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.

**⁷** He will drink of the brook on the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
