# Psalm 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.” 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule among your enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord is at your right hand. He will crush kings in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>6</sup> He will judge among the nations. He will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth. 

<sup>7</sup> He will drink of the brook on the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
