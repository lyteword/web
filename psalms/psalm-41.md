# Psalm 41

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. Blessed is he who considers the poor. Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from his bed of illness. 

<sup>4</sup> I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you.” 

<sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil against me: “When will he die, and his name perish?” 

<sup>6</sup> If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it. 

<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me. 

<sup>8</sup> “An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.” 

<sup>9</sup> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me. 

<sup>10</sup> But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them. 

<sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me. 

<sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever. 

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.
