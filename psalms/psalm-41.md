# Psalm 41 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Blessed is he who considers the poor. Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.

**²** Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.

**³** Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from his bed of illness.

**⁴** I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”

**⁵** My enemies speak evil against me: “When will he die, and his name perish?”

**⁶** If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.

**⁷** All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me.

**⁸** “An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”

**⁹** Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me.

**¹⁰** But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.

**¹¹** By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.

**¹²** As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.

**¹³** Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.
