# Psalm 48

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 

<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the north sides, the city of the great King. 

<sup>3</sup> God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge. 

<sup>4</sup> For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together. 

<sup>5</sup> They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away. 

<sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail. 

<sup>7</sup> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish. 

<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the middle of your temple. 

<sup>10</sup> As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness. 

<sup>11</sup> Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments. 

<sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go around her. Number its towers. 

<sup>13</sup> Notice her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation. 

<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
