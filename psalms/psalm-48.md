# Psalm 48 

A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.

**¹** Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.

**²** Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the north sides, the city of the great King.

**³** God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.

**⁴** For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together.

**⁵** They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away.

**⁶** Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.

**⁷** With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.

**⁸** As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁹** We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the middle of your temple.

**¹⁰** As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.

**¹¹** Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.

**¹²** Walk about Zion, and go around her. Number its towers.

**¹³** Notice her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation.

**¹⁴** For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
