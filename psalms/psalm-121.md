# Psalm 121

A Song of Ascents.

<sup>1</sup> I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from?

<sup>2</sup> My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

<sup>3</sup> He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.

<sup>4</sup> Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.

<sup>6</sup> The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forward, and forever more.
