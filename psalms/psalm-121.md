# Psalm 121

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from?

**²** My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

**³** He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.

**⁴** Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

**⁵** Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.

**⁶** The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.

**⁷** Yahweh will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul.

**⁸** Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forward, and forever more.
