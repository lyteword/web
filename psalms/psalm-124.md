# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. By David. If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say, 

<sup>2</sup> if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us, 

<sup>3</sup> then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us, 

<sup>4</sup> then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul. 

<sup>5</sup> Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

<sup>7</sup> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 

<sup>8</sup> Our help is in Yahweh’s name, who made heaven and earth.
