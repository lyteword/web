# Psalm 124

A Song of Ascents. By David.

**¹** If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say,

**²** if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us,

**³** then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us,

**⁴** then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul.

**⁵** Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.

**⁶** Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.

**⁷** Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.

**⁸** Our help is in Yahweh’s name, who made heaven and earth.
