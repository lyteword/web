# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> A Song. A Psalm by David. My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing and I will make music with my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn. 

<sup>3</sup> I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. I will sing praises to you among the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For your loving kindness is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 

<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us. 

<sup>7</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is my helmet. Judah is my scepter. 

<sup>9</sup> Moab is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom. I will shout over Philistia.” 

<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> Haven’t you rejected us, God? You don’t go out, God, with our armies. 

<sup>12</sup> Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain. 

<sup>13</sup> Through God, we will do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
