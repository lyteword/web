# Psalm 108

A Song. A Psalm by David.

**¹** My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing and I will make music with my soul.

**²** Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.

**³** I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. I will sing praises to you among the peoples.

**⁴** For your loving kindness is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

**⁵** Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth.

**⁶** That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.

**⁷** God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

**⁸** Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is my helmet. Judah is my scepter.

**⁹** Moab is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom. I will shout over Philistia.”

**¹⁰** Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

**¹¹** Haven’t you rejected us, God? You don’t go out, God, with our armies.

**¹²** Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.

**¹³** Through God, we will do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
