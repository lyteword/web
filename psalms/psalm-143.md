# Psalm 143

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. Hear my prayer, Yahweh. Listen to my petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me. 

<sup>2</sup> Don’t enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight no man living is righteous. 

<sup>3</sup> For the enemy pursues my soul. He has struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead. 

<sup>4</sup> Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate. 

<sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands. 

<sup>6</sup> I spread out my hands to you. My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah. 

<sup>7</sup> Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. My spirit fails. Don’t hide your face from me, so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit. 

<sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you. 

<sup>9</sup> Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. I flee to you to hide me. 

<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness. 

<sup>11</sup> Revive me, Yahweh, for your name’s sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble. 

<sup>12</sup> In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.
