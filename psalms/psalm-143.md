# Psalm 143

A Psalm by David.

**¹** Hear my prayer, Yahweh. Listen to my petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.

**²** Don’t enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight no man living is righteous.

**³** For the enemy pursues my soul. He has struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.

**⁴** Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.

**⁵** I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands.

**⁶** I spread out my hands to you. My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁷** Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. My spirit fails. Don’t hide your face from me, so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit.

**⁸** Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you.

**⁹** Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. I flee to you to hide me.

**¹⁰** Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.

**¹¹** Revive me, Yahweh, for your name’s sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.

**¹²** In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.
