# Psalm 64

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

**²** Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;

**³** who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words,

**⁴** to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.

**⁵** They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, “Who will see them?”

**⁶** They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!” Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.

**⁷** But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.

**⁸** Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads.

**⁹** All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done.

**¹⁰** The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
