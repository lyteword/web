# Psalm 64

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil; 

<sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words, 

<sup>4</sup> to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly. 

<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, “Who will see them?” 

<sup>6</sup> They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!” Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning. 

<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow. 

<sup>8</sup> Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads. 

<sup>9</sup> All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
