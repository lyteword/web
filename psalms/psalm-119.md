<sup>1</sup> ALEPH Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to Yahweh’s law. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with their whole heart. 

<sup>3</sup> Yes, they do nothing wrong. They walk in his ways. 

<sup>4</sup> You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes! 

<sup>6</sup> Then I wouldn’t be disappointed, when I consider all of your commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I learn your righteous judgments. 

<sup>8</sup> I will observe your statutes. Don’t utterly forsake me. BETH 

<sup>9</sup> How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. 

<sup>10</sup> With my whole heart I have sought you. Don’t let me wander from your commandments. 

<sup>11</sup> I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.
