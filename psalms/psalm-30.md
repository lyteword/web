# Psalm 30 

A Psalm. A Song for the Dedication of the Temple. By David.

**¹** I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.

**²** Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.

**³** Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.[^432] You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

**⁴** Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his. Give thanks to his holy name.

**⁵** For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.

**⁶** As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.”

**⁷** You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled.

**⁸** I cried to you, Yahweh. I made supplication to the Lord:

**⁹** “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth?

**¹⁰** Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. Yahweh, be my helper.”

**¹¹** You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,

**¹²** to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

[^432]: 30:3 Sheol is the place of the dead.
