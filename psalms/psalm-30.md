# Psalm 30

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. A Song for the Dedication of the Temple. By David. I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his. Give thanks to his holy name. 

<sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning. 

<sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.” 

<sup>7</sup> You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled. 

<sup>8</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh. I made supplication to the Lord: 

<sup>9</sup> “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth? 

<sup>10</sup> Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. Yahweh, be my helper.” 

<sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness, 

<sup>12</sup> to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
