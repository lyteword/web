# Psalm 11

For the Chief Musician. By David.

**¹** In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?

**²** For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

**³** If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?

**⁴** Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.

**⁵** Yahweh examines the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.

**⁶** On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.

**⁷** For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
