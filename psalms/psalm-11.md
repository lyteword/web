# Psalm 11

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. By David. In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”? 

<sup>2</sup> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 

<sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men. 

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh examines the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence. 

<sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

<sup>7</sup> For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
