# Psalm 133

A Song of Ascents. By David.

**¹** See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!

**²** It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron’s beard, that came down on the edge of his robes,

**³** like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion; for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forever more.
