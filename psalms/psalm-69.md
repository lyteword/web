# Psalm 69 

For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Lilies.” By David.

**¹** Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!

**²** I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

**³** I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail looking for my God.

**⁴** Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn’t take away.

**⁵** God, you know my foolishness. My sins aren’t hidden from you.

**⁶** Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.

**⁷** Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.

**⁸** I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children.

**⁹** For the zeal of your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.

**¹⁰** When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.

**¹¹** When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.

**¹²** Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.

**¹³** But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.

**¹⁴** Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

**¹⁵** Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.

**¹⁶** Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.

**¹⁷** Don’t hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!

**¹⁸** Draw near to my soul and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.

**¹⁹** You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.

**²⁰** Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.

**²¹** They also gave me poison for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.

**²²** Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.

**²³** Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. Let their backs be continually bent.

**²⁴** Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.

**²⁵** Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents.

**²⁶** For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.

**²⁷** Charge them with crime upon crime. Don’t let them come into your righteousness.

**²⁸** Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.

**²⁹** But I am in pain and distress. Let your salvation, God, protect me.

**³⁰** I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

**³¹** It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.

**³²** The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live.

**³³** For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn’t despise his captive people.

**³⁴** Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moves therein!

**³⁵** For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it.

**³⁶** The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
