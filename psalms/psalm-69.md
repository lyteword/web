# Psalm 69

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Lilies.” By David. Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck! 

<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 

<sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail looking for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn’t take away. 

<sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness. My sins aren’t hidden from you. 

<sup>6</sup> Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children. 

<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. 

<sup>10</sup> When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach. 

<sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them. 

<sup>12</sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation. 

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me. 

<sup>16</sup> Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me. 

<sup>17</sup> Don’t hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily! 

<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies. 

<sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you. 

<sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none. 

<sup>21</sup> They also gave me poison for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. 

<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap. 

<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. Let their backs be continually bent. 

<sup>24</sup> Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them. 

<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt. 

<sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime. Don’t let them come into your righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous. 

<sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress. Let your salvation, God, protect me. 

<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 

<sup>31</sup> It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs. 

<sup>32</sup> The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live. 

<sup>33</sup> For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn’t despise his captive people. 

<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moves therein! 

<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it. 

<sup>36</sup> The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
