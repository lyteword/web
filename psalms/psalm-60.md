# Psalm 60

For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.

**¹** God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.

**²** You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes.

**³** You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.

**⁴** You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.

**⁶** God has spoken from his sanctuary: “I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

**⁷** Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.

**⁸** Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my sandal on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia.”

**⁹** Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?

**¹⁰** Haven’t you, God, rejected us? You don’t go out with our armies, God.

**¹¹** Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain.

**¹²** Through God we will do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
