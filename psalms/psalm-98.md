# Psalm 98

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him. 

<sup>2</sup> Yahweh has made known his salvation. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises! 

<sup>5</sup> Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody. 

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and sound of the ramâ€™s horn, make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein. 

<sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together. 

<sup>9</sup> Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
