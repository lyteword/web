# Psalm 96 

**¹** Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.

**²** Sing to Yahweh! Bless his name! Proclaim his salvation from day to day!

**³** Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.

**⁴** For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all gods.

**⁵** For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.

**⁶** Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

**⁷** Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.

**⁸** Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.

**⁹** Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.

**¹⁰** Say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns.” The world is also established. It can’t be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity.

**¹¹** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness!

**¹²** Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy

**¹³** before Yahweh; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with his truth.
