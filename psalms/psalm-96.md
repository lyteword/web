# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing to Yahweh! Bless his name! Proclaim his salvation from day to day! 

<sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

<sup>9</sup> Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns.” The world is also established. It can’t be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness! 

<sup>12</sup> Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy 

<sup>13</sup> before Yahweh; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with his truth.
