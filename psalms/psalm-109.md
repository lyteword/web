# Psalm 109 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** God of my praise, don’t remain silent,

**²** for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.

**³** They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

**⁴** In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I am in prayer.

**⁵** They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

**⁶** Set a wicked man over him. Let an adversary stand at his right hand.

**⁷** When he is judged, let him come out guilty. Let his prayer be turned into sin.

**⁸** Let his days be few. Let another take his office.

**⁹** Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

**¹⁰** Let his children be wandering beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.

**¹¹** Let the creditor seize all that he has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.

**¹²** Let there be no one to extend kindness to him, neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.

**¹³** Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.

**¹⁴** Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh. Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.

**¹⁵** Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off their memory from the earth;

**¹⁶** because he didn’t remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.

**¹⁷** Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him. He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

**¹⁸** He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment. It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.

**¹⁹** Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself, for the belt that is always around him.

**²⁰** This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those who speak evil against my soul.

**²¹** But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,[^457] for your name’s sake, because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;

**²²** for I am poor and needy. My heart is wounded within me.

**²³** I fade away like an evening shadow. I am shaken off like a locust.

**²⁴** My knees are weak through fasting. My body is thin and lacks fat.

**²⁵** I have also become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.

**²⁶** Help me, Yahweh, my God. Save me according to your loving kindness;

**²⁷** that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh, have done it.

**²⁸** They may curse, but you bless. When they arise, they will be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.

**²⁹** Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.

**³⁰** I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth. Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.

**³¹** For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul.

[^457]: 109:21 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
