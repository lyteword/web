# Psalm 109

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

<sup>1</sup> God of my praise, don’t remain silent,

<sup>2</sup> for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.

<sup>3</sup> They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

<sup>4</sup> In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I am in prayer.

<sup>5</sup> They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

<sup>6</sup> Set a wicked man over him. Let an adversary stand at his right hand.

<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come out guilty. Let his prayer be turned into sin.

<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few. Let another take his office.

<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

<sup>10</sup> Let his children be wandering beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.

<sup>11</sup> Let the creditor seize all that he has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.

<sup>12</sup> Let there be no one to extend kindness to him, neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.

<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.

<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh. Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.

<sup>15</sup> Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off their memory from the earth;

<sup>16</sup> because he didn’t remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.

<sup>17</sup> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him. He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

<sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment. It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.

<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself, for the belt that is always around him.

<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those who speak evil against my soul.

<sup>21</sup> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,[^457] for your name’s sake, because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;

<sup>22</sup> for I am poor and needy. My heart is wounded within me.

<sup>23</sup> I fade away like an evening shadow. I am shaken off like a locust.

<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting. My body is thin and lacks fat.

<sup>25</sup> I have also become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.

<sup>26</sup> Help me, Yahweh, my God. Save me according to your loving kindness;

<sup>27</sup> that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh, have done it.

<sup>28</sup> They may curse, but you bless. When they arise, they will be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.

<sup>29</sup> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.

<sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth. Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.

<sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul.

[^457]: 109:21 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
