# Psalm 49

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. Hear this, all you peoples. Listen, all you inhabitants of the world, 

<sup>2</sup> both low and high, rich and poor together. 

<sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom. My heart will utter understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> I will incline my ear to a proverb. I will solve my riddle on the harp. 

<sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels surrounds me? 

<sup>6</sup> Those who trust in their wealth, and boast in the multitude of their riches— 

<sup>7</sup> none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give God a ransom for him. 

<sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough, 

<sup>9</sup> that he should live on forever, that he should not see corruption. 

<sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever, and their dwelling places to all generations. They name their lands after themselves. 

<sup>12</sup> But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure. He is like the animals that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of those who are foolish, and of those who approve their sayings. Selah. 

<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. Their beauty shall decay in Sheol, far from their mansion. 

<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah. 

<sup>16</sup> Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 

<sup>17</sup> for when he dies he will carry nothing away. His glory won’t descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul— and men praise you when you do well for yourself— 

<sup>19</sup> he shall go to the generation of his fathers. They shall never see the light. 

<sup>20</sup> A man who has riches without understanding, is like the animals that perish.
