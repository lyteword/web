# Psalm 13 

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.

**¹** How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?

**²** How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?

**³** Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;

**⁴** lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.

**⁵** But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation.

**⁶** I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
