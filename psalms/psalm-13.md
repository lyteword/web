# Psalm 13

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

<sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me? 

<sup>3</sup> Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 

<sup>4</sup> lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall. 

<sup>5</sup> But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
