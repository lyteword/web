# Psalm 135

**¹** Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh’s name! Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,

**²** you who stand in Yahweh’s house, in the courts of our God’s house.

**³** Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.

**⁴** For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his own possession.

**⁵** For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods.

**⁶** Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.

**⁷** He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with the rain. He brings the wind out of his treasuries.

**⁸** He struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal.

**⁹** He sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.

**¹⁰** He struck many nations, and killed mighty kings—

**¹¹** Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan—

**¹²** and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.

**¹³** Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.

**¹⁴** For Yahweh will judge his people and have compassion on his servants.

**¹⁵** The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.

**¹⁶** They have mouths, but they can’t speak. They have eyes, but they can’t see.

**¹⁷** They have ears, but they can’t hear, neither is there any breath in their mouths.

**¹⁸** Those who make them will be like them, yes, everyone who trusts in them.

**¹⁹** House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!

**²⁰** House of Levi, praise Yahweh! You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!

**²¹** Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
