# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh’s name! Praise him, you servants of Yahweh, 

<sup>2</sup> you who stand in Yahweh’s house, in the courts of our God’s house. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant. 

<sup>4</sup> For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his own possession. 

<sup>5</sup> For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. 

<sup>7</sup> He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with the rain. He brings the wind out of his treasuries. 

<sup>8</sup> He struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal. 

<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants. 

<sup>10</sup> He struck many nations, and killed mighty kings— 

<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan— 

<sup>12</sup> and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people. 

<sup>13</sup> Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh will judge his people and have compassion on his servants. 

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they can’t speak. They have eyes, but they can’t see. 

<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they can’t hear, neither is there any breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> Those who make them will be like them, yes, everyone who trusts in them. 

<sup>19</sup> House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House of Aaron, praise Yahweh! 

<sup>20</sup> House of Levi, praise Yahweh! You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh! 

<sup>21</sup> Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
