# Psalm 132

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,

**²** how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

**³** “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed;

**⁴** I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,

**⁵** until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”

**⁶** Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar.

**⁷** “We will go into his dwelling place. We will worship at his footstool.”

**⁸** Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength.

**⁹** Let your priests be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!

**¹⁰** For your servant David’s sake, don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.

**¹¹** Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: “I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.

**¹²** If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”

**¹³** For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.

**¹⁴** “This is my resting place forever. I will live here, for I have desired it.

**¹⁵** I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.

**¹⁶** I will also clothe her priests with salvation. Her saints will shout aloud for joy.

**¹⁷** I will make the horn of David to bud there. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.

**¹⁸** I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will shine.”
