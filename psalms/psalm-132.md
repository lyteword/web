# Psalm 132

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction, 

<sup>2</sup> how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 

<sup>3</sup> “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed; 

<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids, 

<sup>5</sup> until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 

<sup>6</sup> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar. 

<sup>7</sup> “We will go into his dwelling place. We will worship at his footstool.” 

<sup>8</sup> Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength. 

<sup>9</sup> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy! 

<sup>10</sup> For your servant David’s sake, don’t turn away the face of your anointed one. 

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: “I will set the fruit of your body on your throne. 

<sup>12</sup> If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forever more.” 

<sup>13</sup> For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation. 

<sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place forever. I will live here, for I have desired it. 

<sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

<sup>16</sup> I will also clothe her priests with salvation. Her saints will shout aloud for joy. 

<sup>17</sup> I will make the horn of David to bud there. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed. 

<sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will shine.”
