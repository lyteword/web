# Psalm 84

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies! 

<sup>2</sup> My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 

<sup>3</sup> Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage. 

<sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings. 

<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength. Every one of them appears before God in Zion. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacob. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed. 

<sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

<sup>11</sup> For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly. 

<sup>12</sup> Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
