# Psalm 84 

For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.

**¹** How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies!

**²** My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.

**³** Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.

**⁴** Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. *Selah.*

**⁵** Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.

**⁶** Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.

**⁷** They go from strength to strength. Every one of them appears before God in Zion.

**⁸** Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacob. *Selah.*

**⁹** Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.

**¹⁰** For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

**¹¹** For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.

**¹²** Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
