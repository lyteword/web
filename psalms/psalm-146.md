# Psalm 146

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 

<sup>3</sup> Donâ€™t put your trust in princes, in a son of man in whom there is no help. 

<sup>4</sup> His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish. 

<sup>5</sup> Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God, 

<sup>6</sup> who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever; 

<sup>7</sup> who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners. 

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous. 

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but he turns the way of the wicked upside down. 

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!
