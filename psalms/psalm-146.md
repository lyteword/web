# Psalm 146 

**¹** Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.

**²** While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.

**³** Don’t put your trust in princes, in a son of man in whom there is no help.

**⁴** His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.

**⁵** Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God,

**⁶** who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;

**⁷** who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners.

**⁸** Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous.

**⁹** Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but he turns the way of the wicked upside down.

**¹⁰** Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!
