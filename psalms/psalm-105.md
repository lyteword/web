# Psalm 105

**¹** Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples.

**²** Sing to him, sing praises to him! Tell of all his marvelous works.

**³** Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.

**⁴** Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.

**⁵** Remember his marvelous works that he has done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

**⁶** you offspring of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

**⁷** He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments are in all the earth.

**⁸** He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

**⁹** the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,

**¹⁰** and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

**¹¹** saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,”

**¹²** when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.

**¹³** They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.

**¹⁴** He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,

**¹⁵** “Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”

**¹⁶** He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.

**¹⁷** He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.

**¹⁸** They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,

**¹⁹** until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh’s word proved him true.

**²⁰** The king sent and freed him, even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.

**²¹** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions,

**²²** to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.

**²³** Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham.

**²⁴** He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.

**²⁵** He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.

**²⁶** He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.

**²⁷** They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

**²⁸** He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words.

**²⁹** He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.

**³⁰** Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.

**³¹** He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.

**³²** He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.

**³³** He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.

**³⁴** He spoke, and the locusts came with the grasshoppers, without number.

**³⁵** They ate up every plant in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.

**³⁶** He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.

**³⁷** He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.

**³⁸** Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.

**³⁹** He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.

**⁴⁰** They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.

**⁴¹** He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.

**⁴²** For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.

**⁴³** He brought his people out with joy, his chosen with singing.

**⁴⁴** He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,

**⁴⁵** that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise Yah!
