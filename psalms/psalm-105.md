# Psalm 105

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praises to him! Tell of all his marvelous works. 

<sup>3</sup> Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. 

<sup>4</sup> Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more. 

<sup>5</sup> Remember his marvelous works that he has done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 

<sup>6</sup> you offspring of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

<sup>7</sup> He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments are in all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 

<sup>9</sup> the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac, 

<sup>10</sup> and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 

<sup>11</sup> saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,” 

<sup>12</sup> when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it. 

<sup>13</sup> They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. 

<sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, 

<sup>15</sup> “Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!” 

<sup>16</sup> He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave. 

<sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons, 

<sup>19</sup> until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh’s word proved him true. 

<sup>20</sup> The king sent and freed him, even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions, 

<sup>22</sup> to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. 

<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words. 

<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish. 

<sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings. 

<sup>31</sup> He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders. 

<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. 

<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came with the grasshoppers, without number. 

<sup>35</sup> They ate up every plant in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground. 

<sup>36</sup> He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood. 

<sup>37</sup> He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes. 

<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them. 

<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky. 

<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places. 

<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant. 

<sup>43</sup> He brought his people out with joy, his chosen with singing. 

<sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession, 

<sup>45</sup> that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise Yah!
