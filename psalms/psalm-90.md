# Psalm 90

A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.[^450]

**¹** Lord,[^451] you have been our dwelling place for all generations.

**²** Before the mountains were born, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

**³** You turn man to destruction, saying, “Return, you children of men.”

**⁴** For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night.

**⁵** You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass.

**⁶** In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry.

**⁷** For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath.

**⁸** You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.

**⁹** For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.

**¹⁰** The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.

**¹¹** Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?

**¹²** So teach us to count our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

**¹³** Relent, Yahweh![^452] How long? Have compassion on your servants!

**¹⁴** Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

**¹⁵** Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.

**¹⁶** Let your work appear to your servants, your glory to their children.

**¹⁷** Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us. Establish the work of our hands for us. Yes, establish the work of our hands.
