# Psalm 90

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer by Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. 

<sup>3</sup> You turn man to destruction, saying, “Return, you children of men.” 

<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night. 

<sup>5</sup> You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass. 

<sup>6</sup> In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry. 

<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath. 

<sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 

<sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh. 

<sup>10</sup> The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away. 

<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you? 

<sup>12</sup> So teach us to count our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Relent, Yahweh! How long? Have compassion on your servants! 

<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

<sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil. 

<sup>16</sup> Let your work appear to your servants, your glory to their children. 

<sup>17</sup> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us. Establish the work of our hands for us. Yes, establish the work of our hands.
