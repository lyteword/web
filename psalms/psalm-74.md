# Psalm 74

<sup>1</sup> A contemplation by Asaph. God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture? 

<sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance: Mount Zion, in which you have lived. 

<sup>3</sup> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary. 

<sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs. 

<sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees. 

<sup>6</sup> Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers. 

<sup>7</sup> They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name. 

<sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.” They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped. 

<sup>9</sup> We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long. 

<sup>10</sup> How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever? 

<sup>11</sup> Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it from your chest and consume them! 

<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old, working salvation throughout the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. 

<sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures. 

<sup>15</sup> You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers. 

<sup>16</sup> The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter. 

<sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name. 

<sup>19</sup> Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don’t forget the life of your poor forever. 

<sup>20</sup> Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth. 

<sup>21</sup> Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name. 

<sup>22</sup> Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day. 

<sup>23</sup> Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
