# Psalm 52

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, “David has come to Ahimelech’s house.” Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God’s loving kindness endures continually. 

<sup>2</sup> Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 

<sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy you forever. He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.” 

<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever. 

<sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.
