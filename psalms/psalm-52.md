# Psalm 52

For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, “David has come to Ahimelech’s house.”

**¹** Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God’s loving kindness endures continually.

**²** Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

**³** You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking the truth. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁴** You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.

**⁵** God will likewise destroy you forever. He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁶** The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,

**⁷** “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”

**⁸** But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.

**⁹** I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.
