# Psalm 118 

**¹** Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.

**²** Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever.

**³** Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness endures forever.

**⁴** Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving kindness endures forever.

**⁵** Out of my distress, I called on Yah. Yah answered me with freedom.

**⁶** Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

**⁷** Yahweh is on my side among those who help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.

**⁸** It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man.

**⁹** It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in princes.

**¹⁰** All the nations surrounded me, but in Yahweh’s name I cut them off.

**¹¹** They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. In Yahweh’s name I indeed cut them off.

**¹²** They surrounded me like bees. They are quenched like the burning thorns. In Yahweh’s name I cut them off.

**¹³** You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.

**¹⁴** Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation.

**¹⁵** The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous. “The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.

**¹⁶** The right hand of Yahweh is exalted! The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!”

**¹⁷** I will not die, but live, and declare Yah’s works.

**¹⁸** Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me over to death.

**¹⁹** Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter into them. I will give thanks to Yah.

**²⁰** This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.

**²¹** I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have become my salvation.

**²²** The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.[^461]

**²³** This is Yahweh’s doing. It is marvelous in our eyes.

**²⁴** This is the day that Yahweh has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it!

**²⁵** Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh! Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now.

**²⁶** Blessed is he who comes in Yahweh’s name! We have blessed you out of Yahweh’s house.

**²⁷** Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.

**²⁸** You are my God, and I will give thanks to you. You are my God, I will exalt you.

**²⁹** Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.
