# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>4</sup> Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>5</sup> Out of my distress, I called on Yah. Yah answered me with freedom. 

<sup>6</sup> Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh is on my side among those who help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me, but in Yahweh’s name I cut them off. 

<sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. In Yahweh’s name I indeed cut them off. 

<sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees. They are quenched like the burning thorns. In Yahweh’s name I cut them off. 

<sup>13</sup> You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous. “The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly. 

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of Yahweh is exalted! The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!” 

<sup>17</sup> I will not die, but live, and declare Yah’s works. 

<sup>18</sup> Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me over to death. 

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter into them. I will give thanks to Yah. 

<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it. 

<sup>21</sup> I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. 

<sup>23</sup> This is Yahweh’s doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> This is the day that Yahweh has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it! 

<sup>25</sup> Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh! Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now. 

<sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in Yahweh’s name! We have blessed you out of Yahweh’s house. 

<sup>27</sup> Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give thanks to you. You are my God, I will exalt you. 

<sup>29</sup> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.
