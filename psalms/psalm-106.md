# Psalm 106 

**¹** Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.

**²** Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare all his praise?

**³** Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.

**⁴** Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,

**⁵** that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.

**⁶** We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.

**⁷** Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

**⁸** Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power known.

**⁹** He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.

**¹⁰** He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

**¹¹** The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.

**¹²** Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.

**¹³** They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel,

**¹⁴** but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.

**¹⁵** He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.

**¹⁶** They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.

**¹⁷** The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

**¹⁸** A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.

**¹⁹** They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.

**²⁰** Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.

**²¹** They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,

**²²** wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.

**²³** Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.

**²⁴** Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t believe his word,

**²⁵** but murmured in their tents, and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.

**²⁶** Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,

**²⁷** that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.

**²⁸** They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

**²⁹** Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.

**³⁰** Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.

**³¹** That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.

**³²** They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;

**³³** because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.

**³⁴** They didn’t destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,

**³⁵** but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.

**³⁶** They served their idols, which became a snare to them.

**³⁷** Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.

**³⁸** They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.

**³⁹** Thus they were defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.

**⁴⁰** Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.

**⁴¹** He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.

**⁴²** Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.

**⁴³** He rescued them many times, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.

**⁴⁴** Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.

**⁴⁵** He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.

**⁴⁶** He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.

**⁴⁷** Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!

**⁴⁸** Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, “Amen.” Praise Yah!
