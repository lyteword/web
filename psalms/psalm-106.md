# Psalm 106

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare all his praise? 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times. 

<sup>4</sup> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation, 

<sup>5</sup> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance. 

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power known. 

<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert. 

<sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left. 

<sup>12</sup> Then they believed his words. They sang his praise. 

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel, 

<sup>14</sup> but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland. 

<sup>15</sup> He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul. 

<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint. 

<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image. 

<sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass. 

<sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 

<sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them. 

<sup>24</sup> Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t believe his word, 

<sup>25</sup> but murmured in their tents, and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice. 

<sup>26</sup> Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness, 

<sup>27</sup> that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands. 

<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 

<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them. 

<sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped. 

<sup>31</sup> That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come. 

<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes; 

<sup>33</sup> because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> They didn’t destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them, 

<sup>35</sup> but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works. 

<sup>36</sup> They served their idols, which became a snare to them. 

<sup>37</sup> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 

<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood. 

<sup>39</sup> Thus they were defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds. 

<sup>40</sup> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance. 

<sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand. 

<sup>43</sup> He rescued them many times, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry. 

<sup>45</sup> He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. 

<sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive. 

<sup>47</sup> Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise! 

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, “Amen.” Praise Yah!
