# Psalm 94

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out. 

<sup>2</sup> Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back the proud what they deserve. 

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph? 

<sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words. All the evildoers boast. 

<sup>5</sup> They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless. 

<sup>7</sup> They say, “Yah will not see, neither will Jacob’s God consider.” 

<sup>8</sup> Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools, when will you be wise? 

<sup>9</sup> He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear? He who formed the eye, won’t he see? 

<sup>10</sup> He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish? He who teaches man knows. 

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out of your law, 

<sup>13</sup> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked. 

<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh won’t reject his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 

<sup>15</sup> For judgment will return to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it. 

<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers? 

<sup>17</sup> Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon lived in silence. 

<sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot is slipping!” Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up. 

<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul. 

<sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, which brings about mischief by statute? 

<sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 

<sup>22</sup> But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge. 

<sup>23</sup> He has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
