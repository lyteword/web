# Psalm 94

**¹** Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out.

**²** Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back the proud what they deserve.

**³** Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?

**⁴** They pour out arrogant words. All the evildoers boast.

**⁵** They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.

**⁶** They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.

**⁷** They say, “Yah will not see, neither will Jacob’s God consider.”

**⁸** Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools, when will you be wise?

**⁹** He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear? He who formed the eye, won’t he see?

**¹⁰** He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish? He who teaches man knows.

**¹¹** Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.

**¹²** Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out of your law,

**¹³** that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.

**¹⁴** For Yahweh won’t reject his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.

**¹⁵** For judgment will return to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.

**¹⁶** Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?

**¹⁷** Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon lived in silence.

**¹⁸** When I said, “My foot is slipping!” Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.

**¹⁹** In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.

**²⁰** Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, which brings about mischief by statute?

**²¹** They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

**²²** But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.

**²³** He has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
