# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp! 

<sup>4</sup> For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the saints rejoice in honor. Let them sing for joy on their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand, 

<sup>7</sup> to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples; 

<sup>8</sup> to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 

<sup>9</sup> to execute on them the written judgment. All his saints have this honor. Praise Yah!
