# Psalm 149

**¹** Praise Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints.

**²** Let Israel rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.

**³** Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp!

**⁴** For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with salvation.

**⁵** Let the saints rejoice in honor. Let them sing for joy on their beds.

**⁶** May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand,

**⁷** to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;

**⁸** to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;

**⁹** to execute on them the written judgment. All his saints have this honor. Praise Yah!
