# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh from the heavens! Praise him in the heights! 

<sup>2</sup> Praise him, all his angels! Praise him, all his army! 

<sup>3</sup> Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars! 

<sup>4</sup> Praise him, you heavens of heavens, you waters that are above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise Yahweh’s name, for he commanded, and they were created. 

<sup>6</sup> He has also established them forever and ever. He has made a decree which will not pass away. 

<sup>7</sup> Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures, and all depths, 

<sup>8</sup> lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy wind, fulfilling his word, 

<sup>9</sup> mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, 

<sup>10</sup> wild animals and all livestock, small creatures and flying birds, 

<sup>11</sup> kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth, 

<sup>12</sup> both young men and maidens, old men and children. 

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise Yahweh’s name, for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the heavens. 

<sup>14</sup> He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise Yah!
