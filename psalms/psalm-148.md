# Psalm 148

**¹** Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh from the heavens! Praise him in the heights!

**²** Praise him, all his angels! Praise him, all his army!

**³** Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars!

**⁴** Praise him, you heavens of heavens, you waters that are above the heavens.

**⁵** Let them praise Yahweh’s name, for he commanded, and they were created.

**⁶** He has also established them forever and ever. He has made a decree which will not pass away.

**⁷** Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures, and all depths,

**⁸** lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy wind, fulfilling his word,

**⁹** mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,

**¹⁰** wild animals and all livestock, small creatures and flying birds,

**¹¹** kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth,

**¹²** both young men and maidens, old men and children.

**¹³** Let them praise Yahweh’s name, for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the heavens.

**¹⁴** He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near to him. Praise Yah!
