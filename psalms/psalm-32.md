# Psalm 32 

By David. A contemplative psalm.

**¹** Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

**²** Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit.

**³** When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.

**⁴** For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁵** I acknowledged my sin to you. I didn’t hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁶** For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.

**⁷** You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of deliverance. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁸** I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will counsel you with my eye on you.

**⁹** Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.

**¹⁰** Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.

**¹¹** Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
