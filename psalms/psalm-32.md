# Psalm 32

<sup>1</sup> By David. A contemplative psalm. Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit. 

<sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to you. I didn’t hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 

<sup>6</sup> For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him. 

<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will counsel you with my eye on you. 

<sup>9</sup> Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you. 

<sup>10</sup> Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh. 

<sup>11</sup> Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
