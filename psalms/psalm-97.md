# Psalm 97

**¹** Yahweh reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad!

**²** Clouds and darkness are around him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

**³** A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side.

**⁴** His lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles.

**⁵** The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

**⁶** The heavens declare his righteousness. All the peoples have seen his glory.

**⁷** Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast in their idols. Worship him, all you gods![^453]

**⁸** Zion heard and was glad. The daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, Yahweh.

**⁹** For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all gods.

**¹⁰** You who love Yahweh, hate evil! He preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

**¹¹** Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

**¹²** Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people! Give thanks to his holy Name.

[^453]: 97:7 LXX reads “angels” instead of “gods”.
