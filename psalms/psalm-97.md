# Psalm 97

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad! 

<sup>2</sup> Clouds and darkness are around him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 

<sup>3</sup> A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side. 

<sup>4</sup> His lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles. 

<sup>5</sup> The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

<sup>6</sup> The heavens declare his righteousness. All the peoples have seen his glory. 

<sup>7</sup> Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast in their idols. Worship him, all you gods! 

<sup>8</sup> Zion heard and was glad. The daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, Yahweh. 

<sup>9</sup> For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all gods. 

<sup>10</sup> You who love Yahweh, hate evil! He preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 

<sup>12</sup> Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people! Give thanks to his holy Name.
