# Psalm 82

A Psalm by Asaph.

**¹** God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.

**²** “How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” \qs Selah.\qs*

**³** “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.

**⁴** Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”

**⁵** They don’t know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

**⁶** I said, “You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.

**⁷** Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.”

**⁸** Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
