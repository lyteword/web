# Psalm 82

A Psalm by Asaph.

<sup>1</sup> God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>3</sup> “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.

<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”

<sup>5</sup> They don’t know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

<sup>6</sup> I said, “You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.

<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.”

<sup>8</sup> Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
