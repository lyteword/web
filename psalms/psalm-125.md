# Psalm 125 

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can’t be moved, but remains forever.

**²** As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.

**³** For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous, so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.

**⁴** Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts.

**⁵** But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.
