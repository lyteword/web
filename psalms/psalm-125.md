# Psalm 125

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can’t be moved, but remains forever. 

<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. 

<sup>3</sup> For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous, so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil. 

<sup>4</sup> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts. 

<sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.
