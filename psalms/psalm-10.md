# Psalm 10

<sup>1</sup> Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? 

<sup>2</sup> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise. 

<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh. 

<sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God. 

<sup>5</sup> His ways are prosperous at all times. He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them. 

<sup>6</sup> He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.” 

<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. 

<sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless. 

<sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net. 

<sup>10</sup> The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength. 

<sup>11</sup> He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.” 

<sup>12</sup> Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don’t forget the helpless. 

<sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”? 

<sup>14</sup> But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless. 

<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none. 

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land. 

<sup>17</sup> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear, 

<sup>18</sup> to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
