# Psalm 10 

**¹** Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

**²** In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.

**³** For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh.

**⁴** The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.

**⁵** His ways are prosperous at all times. He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.

**⁶** He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.”

**⁷** His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

**⁸** He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.

**⁹** He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.

**¹⁰** The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.

**¹¹** He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.”

**¹²** Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don’t forget the helpless.

**¹³** Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”?

**¹⁴** But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.

**¹⁵** Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.

**¹⁶** Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land.

**¹⁷** Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,

**¹⁸** to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
