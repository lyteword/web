# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. By David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!” 

<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem! 

<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together, 

<sup>4</sup> where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes, according to an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to Yahweh’s name. 

<sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of David’s house. 

<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper. 

<sup>7</sup> Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces. 

<sup>8</sup> For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes, I will now say, “Peace be within you.” 

<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
