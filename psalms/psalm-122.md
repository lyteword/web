# Psalm 122 

A Song of Ascents. By David.

**¹** I was glad when they said to me, “Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”

**²** Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem!

**³** Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together,

**⁴** where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes, according to an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.

**⁵** For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of David’s house.

**⁶** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper.

**⁷** Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.

**⁸** For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes, I will now say, “Peace be within you.”

**⁹** For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
