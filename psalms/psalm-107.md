# Psalm 107

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary, 

<sup>3</sup> and gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in. 

<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 

<sup>6</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 

<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good. 

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron, 

<sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High. 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was no one to help. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke away their chains. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> For he has broken the gates of bronze, and cut through bars of iron. 

<sup>17</sup> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities. 

<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saves them out of their distresses. 

<sup>20</sup> He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves. 

<sup>21</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his deeds with singing. 

<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters, 

<sup>24</sup> these see Yahweh’s deeds, and his wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves. 

<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble. 

<sup>27</sup> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress. 

<sup>29</sup> He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still. 

<sup>30</sup> Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their desired haven. 

<sup>31</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds for the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground, 

<sup>34</sup> and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it. 

<sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs. 

<sup>36</sup> There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in, 

<sup>37</sup> sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase. 

<sup>38</sup> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease. 

<sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 

<sup>40</sup> He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste. 

<sup>41</sup> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths. 

<sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.
