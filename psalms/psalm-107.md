# Psalm 107

**¹** Give thanks to Yahweh,[^455] for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.

**²** Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

**³** and gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

**⁴** They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.

**⁵** Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

**⁶** Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

**⁷** He led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.

**⁸** Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

**⁹** For he satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good.

**¹⁰** Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,

**¹¹** because they rebelled against the words of God,[^456] and condemned the counsel of the Most High.

**¹²** Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was no one to help.

**¹³** Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

**¹⁴** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke away their chains.

**¹⁵** Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

**¹⁶** For he has broken the gates of bronze, and cut through bars of iron.

**¹⁷** Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities.

**¹⁸** Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.

**¹⁹** Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saves them out of their distresses.

**²⁰** He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.

**²¹** Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

**²²** Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his deeds with singing.

**²³** Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters,

**²⁴** these see Yahweh’s deeds, and his wonders in the deep.

**²⁵** For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.

**²⁶** They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.

**²⁷** They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.

**²⁸** Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.

**²⁹** He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.

**³⁰** Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their desired haven.

**³¹** Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!

**³²** Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.

**³³** He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,

**³⁴** and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

**³⁵** He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.

**³⁶** There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,

**³⁷** sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.

**³⁸** He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.

**³⁹** Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.

**⁴⁰** He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.

**⁴¹** Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.

**⁴²** The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths.

**⁴³** Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

[^455]: 107:1 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.
[^456]: 107:11 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “ אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
