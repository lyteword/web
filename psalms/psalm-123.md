# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. I lift up my eyes to you, you who sit in the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us. 

<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt. 

<sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
