# Psalm 123 

A Song of Ascents.

**¹** I lift up my eyes to you, you who sit in the heavens.

**²** Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.

**³** Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt.

**⁴** Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
