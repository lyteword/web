# Psalm 50

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by Asaph. The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset. 

<sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines out. 

<sup>3</sup> Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before him. It is very stormy around him. 

<sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may judge his people: 

<sup>5</sup> “Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 

<sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah. 

<sup>7</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will speak. Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 

<sup>8</sup> I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me. 

<sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats from your pens. 

<sup>10</sup> For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills. 

<sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine. 

<sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it. 

<sup>13</sup> Will I eat the meat of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 

<sup>14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High. 

<sup>15</sup> Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me.” 

<sup>16</sup> But to the wicked God says, “What right do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips, 

<sup>17</sup> since you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you? 

<sup>18</sup> When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have participated with adulterers. 

<sup>19</sup> “You give your mouth to evil. Your tongue frames deceit. 

<sup>20</sup> You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother’s son. 

<sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent. You thought that I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes. 

<sup>22</sup> “Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”
