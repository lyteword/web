# Psalm 50 

A Psalm by Asaph.

**¹** The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.

**²** Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines out.

**³** Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before him. It is very stormy around him.

**⁴** He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may judge his people:

**⁵** “Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”

**⁶** The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. *Selah.*

**⁷** “Hear, my people, and I will speak. Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God.

**⁸** I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me.

**⁹** I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats from your pens.

**¹⁰** For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills.

**¹¹** I know all the birds of the mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine.

**¹²** If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.

**¹³** Will I eat the meat of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

**¹⁴** Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High.

**¹⁵** Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”

**¹⁶** But to the wicked God says, “What right do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips,

**¹⁷** since you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you?

**¹⁸** When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have participated with adulterers.

**¹⁹** “You give your mouth to evil. Your tongue frames deceit.

**²⁰** You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother’s son.

**²¹** You have done these things, and I kept silent. You thought that I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.

**²²** “Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.

**²³** Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”
