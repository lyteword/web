# Psalm 95 

**¹** Oh come, let’s sing to Yahweh. Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!

**²** Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let’s extol him with songs!

**³** For Yahweh is a great God, a great King above all gods.

**⁴** In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.

**⁵** The sea is his, and he made it. His hands formed the dry land.

**⁶** Oh come, let’s worship and bow down. Let’s kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,

**⁷** for he is our God. We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would hear his voice!

**⁸** Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,

**⁹** when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.

**¹⁰** Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said, “They are a people who err in their heart. They have not known my ways.”

**¹¹** Therefore I swore in my wrath, “They won’t enter into my rest.”
