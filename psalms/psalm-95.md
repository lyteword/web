# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> Oh come, let’s sing to Yahweh. Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation! 

<sup>2</sup> Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let’s extol him with songs! 

<sup>3</sup> For Yahweh is a great God, a great King above all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his. 

<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it. His hands formed the dry land. 

<sup>6</sup> Oh come, let’s worship and bow down. Let’s kneel before Yahweh, our Maker, 

<sup>7</sup> for he is our God. We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would hear his voice! 

<sup>8</sup> Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 

<sup>9</sup> when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work. 

<sup>10</sup> Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said, “They are a people who err in their heart. They have not known my ways.” 

<sup>11</sup> Therefore I swore in my wrath, “They won’t enter into my rest.”
