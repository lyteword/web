# Psalm 37 

By David.

**¹** Don’t fret because of evildoers, neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.

**²** For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither like the green herb.

**³** Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.

**⁴** Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and he will give you the desires of your heart.

**⁵** Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in him, and he will do this:

**⁶** he will make your righteousness shine out like light, and your justice as the noon day sun.

**⁷** Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him. Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.

**⁸** Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.

**⁹** For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.

**¹⁰** For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.

**¹¹** But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

**¹²** The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth.

**¹³** The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.

**¹⁴** The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright on the path.

**¹⁵** Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be broken.

**¹⁶** Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance of many wicked.

**¹⁷** For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh upholds the righteous.

**¹⁸** Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. Their inheritance shall be forever.

**¹⁹** They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

**²⁰** But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will vanish— vanish like smoke.

**²¹** The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back, but the righteous give generously.

**²²** For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.

**²³** A man’s steps are established by Yahweh. He delights in his way.

**²⁴** Though he stumble, he shall not fall, for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.

**²⁵** I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging for bread.

**²⁶** All day long he deals graciously, and lends. His offspring is blessed.

**²⁷** Depart from evil, and do good. Live securely forever.

**²⁸** For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn’t forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.

**²⁹** The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.

**³⁰** The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks justice.

**³¹** The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide.

**³²** The wicked watch the righteous, and seek to kill him.

**³³** Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

**³⁴** Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

**³⁵** I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

**³⁶** But he passed away, and behold, he was not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.

**³⁷** Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.

**³⁸** As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.

**³⁹** But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.

**⁴⁰** Yahweh helps them and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, because they have taken refuge in him.
