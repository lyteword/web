# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> By David. Don’t fret because of evildoers, neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither like the green herb. 

<sup>3</sup> Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture. 

<sup>4</sup> Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 

<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in him, and he will do this: 

<sup>6</sup> he will make your righteousness shine out like light, and your justice as the noon day sun. 

<sup>7</sup> Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him. Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who makes wicked plots happen. 

<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing. 

<sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land. 

<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there. 

<sup>11</sup> But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth. 

<sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright on the path. 

<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance of many wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh upholds the righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. Their inheritance shall be forever. 

<sup>19</sup> They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will vanish— vanish like smoke. 

<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back, but the righteous give generously. 

<sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> A man’s steps are established by Yahweh. He delights in his way. 

<sup>24</sup> Though he stumble, he shall not fall, for Yahweh holds him up with his hand. 

<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging for bread. 

<sup>26</sup> All day long he deals graciously, and lends. His offspring is blessed. 

<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good. Live securely forever. 

<sup>28</sup> For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn’t forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever. 

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks justice. 

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked watch the righteous, and seek to kill him. 

<sup>33</sup> Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. 

<sup>34</sup> Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it. 

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. 

<sup>36</sup> But he passed away, and behold, he was not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace. 

<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> Yahweh helps them and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, because they have taken refuge in him.
