# Psalm 24

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm by David. The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell in it. 

<sup>2</sup> For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods. 

<sup>3</sup> Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill? Who may stand in his holy place? 

<sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully. 

<sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face—even Jacob. Selah. 

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in. 

<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? Yahweh strong and mighty, Yahweh mighty in battle. 

<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory? Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory! Selah.
