# Psalm 24 

A Psalm by David.

**¹** The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell in it.

**²** For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods.

**³** Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill? Who may stand in his holy place?

**⁴** He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.

**⁵** He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, righteousness from the God of his salvation.

**⁶** This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face—even Jacob. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁷** Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.

**⁸** Who is the King of glory? Yahweh strong and mighty, Yahweh mighty in battle.

**⁹** Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.

**¹⁰** Who is this King of glory? Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory! \qs Selah.\qs*
