# Psalm 113 

**¹** Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise Yahweh’s name.

**²** Blessed be Yahweh’s name, from this time forward and forever more.

**³** From the rising of the sun to its going down, Yahweh’s name is to be praised.

**⁴** Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.

**⁵** Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high,

**⁶** who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?

**⁷** He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the needy from the ash heap,

**⁸** that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

**⁹** He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!
