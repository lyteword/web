# Psalm 113

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise Yahweh’s name. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed be Yahweh’s name, from this time forward and forever more. 

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun to its going down, Yahweh’s name is to be praised. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high, 

<sup>6</sup> who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth? 

<sup>7</sup> He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the needy from the ash heap, 

<sup>8</sup> that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 

<sup>9</sup> He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!
