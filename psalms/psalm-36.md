# Psalm 36

For the Chief Musician. By David, the servant of Yahweh.

<sup>1</sup> A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes.

<sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect and hate his sin.

<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good.

<sup>4</sup> He plots iniquity on his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good. He doesn’t abhor evil.

<sup>5</sup> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.

<sup>7</sup> How precious is your loving kindness, God! The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.

<sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.

<sup>9</sup> For with you is the spring of life. In your light we will see light.

<sup>10</sup> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.

<sup>11</sup> Don’t let the foot of pride come against me. Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.

<sup>12</sup> There the workers of iniquity are fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
