# Psalm 62

For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.

<sup>1</sup> My soul rests in God alone. My salvation is from him.

<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress. I will never be greatly shaken.

<sup>3</sup> How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down, like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

<sup>4</sup> They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from him.

<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. I will not be shaken.

<sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor is with God. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

<sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. \qs Selah.\qs*

<sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than a breath.

<sup>10</sup> Don’t trust in oppression. Don’t become vain in robbery. If riches increase, don’t set your heart on them.

<sup>11</sup> God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God.

<sup>12</sup> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, for you reward every man according to his work.
