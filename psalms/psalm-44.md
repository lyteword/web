# Psalm 44

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm. We have heard with our ears, God; our fathers have told us what work you did in their days, in the days of old. 

<sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad. 

<sup>3</sup> For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them. 

<sup>4</sup> God, you are my King. Command victories for Jacob! 

<sup>5</sup> Through you, we will push down our adversaries. Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us. 

<sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow, neither will my sword save me. 

<sup>7</sup> But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us. 

<sup>8</sup> In God we have made our boast all day long. We will give thanks to your name forever. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don’t go out with our armies. 

<sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take plunder for themselves. 

<sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale. 

<sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us. 

<sup>14</sup> You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face, 

<sup>16</sup> at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>17</sup> All this has come on us, yet we haven’t forgotten you. We haven’t been false to your covenant. 

<sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path, 

<sup>19</sup> though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. 

<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god, 

<sup>21</sup> won’t God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart. 

<sup>22</sup> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. 

<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Don’t reject us forever. 

<sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression? 

<sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body clings to the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.
