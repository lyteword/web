# Psalm 44

For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm.

**¹** We have heard with our ears, God; our fathers have told us what work you did in their days, in the days of old.

**²** You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.

**³** For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them.

**⁴** God, you are my King. Command victories for Jacob!

**⁵** Through you, we will push down our adversaries. Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.

**⁶** For I will not trust in my bow, neither will my sword save me.

**⁷** But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us.

**⁸** In God we have made our boast all day long. We will give thanks to your name forever. \qs Selah.\qs*

**⁹** But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don’t go out with our armies.

**¹⁰** You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.

**¹¹** You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.

**¹²** You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale.

**¹³** You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.

**¹⁴** You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

**¹⁵** All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,

**¹⁶** at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger.

**¹⁷** All this has come on us, yet we haven’t forgotten you. We haven’t been false to your covenant.

**¹⁸** Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path,

**¹⁹** though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

**²⁰** If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange god,

**²¹** won’t God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.

**²²** Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.

**²³** Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord?[^437] Arise! Don’t reject us forever.

**²⁴** Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?

**²⁵** For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body clings to the earth.

**²⁶** Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.

[^437]: 44:23 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
