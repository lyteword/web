# Psalm 102

A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh.

**¹** Hear my prayer, Yahweh! Let my cry come to you.

**²** Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I call.

**³** For my days consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a torch.

**⁴** My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.

**⁵** By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.

**⁶** I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.

**⁷** I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.

**⁸** My enemies reproach me all day. Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.

**⁹** For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,

**¹⁰** because of your indignation and your wrath; for you have taken me up and thrown me away.

**¹¹** My days are like a long shadow. I have withered like grass.

**¹²** But you, Yahweh, will remain forever; your renown endures to all generations.

**¹³** You will arise and have mercy on Zion, for it is time to have pity on her. Yes, the set time has come.

**¹⁴** For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity on her dust.

**¹⁵** So the nations will fear Yahweh’s name, all the kings of the earth your glory.

**¹⁶** For Yahweh has built up Zion. He has appeared in his glory.

**¹⁷** He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.

**¹⁸** This will be written for the generation to come. A people which will be created will praise Yah,

**¹⁹** for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth,

**²⁰** to hear the groans of the prisoner, to free those who are condemned to death,

**²¹** that men may declare Yahweh’s name in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,

**²²** when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.

**²³** He weakened my strength along the course. He shortened my days.

**²⁴** I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.

**²⁵** Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.

**²⁶** They will perish, but you will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.

**²⁷** But you are the same. Your years will have no end.

**²⁸** The children of your servants will continue. Their offspring will be established before you.”
