# Psalm 80

<sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm by Asaph. Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine out. 

<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us! 

<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved. 

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh God of Armies, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people? 

<sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure. 

<sup>6</sup> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves. 

<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved. 

<sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it. 

<sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars. 

<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the sea, its shoots to the River. 

<sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it? 

<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it. 

<sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine, 

<sup>15</sup> the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself. 

<sup>16</sup> It’s burned with fire. It’s cut down. They perish at your rebuke. 

<sup>17</sup> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself. 

<sup>18</sup> So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name. 

<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
