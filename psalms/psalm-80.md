# Psalm 80

For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm by Asaph.

**¹** Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.

**²** Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!

**³** Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

**⁴** Yahweh God of Armies, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?

**⁵** You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.

**⁶** You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.

**⁷** Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

**⁸** You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.

**⁹** You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.

**¹⁰** The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars.

**¹¹** It sent out its branches to the sea, its shoots to the River.

**¹²** Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

**¹³** The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.

**¹⁴** Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,

**¹⁵** the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.

**¹⁶** It’s burned with fire. It’s cut down. They perish at your rebuke.

**¹⁷** Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

**¹⁸** So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.

**¹⁹** Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
