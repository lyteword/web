# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

<sup>2</sup> As it is written in the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you: 

<sup>3</sup> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!’” 

<sup>4</sup> John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. 

<sup>5</sup> All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. 

<sup>6</sup> John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. 

<sup>7</sup> He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. 

<sup>8</sup> I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.” 

<sup>9</sup> In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 

<sup>10</sup> Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 

<sup>11</sup> A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” 

<sup>12</sup> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 

<sup>13</sup> He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him. 

<sup>14</sup> Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom, 

<sup>15</sup> and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.” 

<sup>16</sup> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 

<sup>17</sup> Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.” 

<sup>18</sup> Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. 

<sup>19</sup> Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. 

<sup>20</sup> Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 

<sup>21</sup> They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 

<sup>22</sup> They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 

<sup>23</sup> Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 

<sup>24</sup> saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” 

<sup>25</sup> Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” 

<sup>26</sup> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 

<sup>27</sup> They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” 

<sup>28</sup> The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. 

<sup>29</sup> Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

<sup>30</sup> Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. 

<sup>31</sup> He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately, and she served them. 

<sup>32</sup> At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons. 

<sup>33</sup> All the city was gathered together at the door. 

<sup>34</sup> He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him. 

<sup>35</sup> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. 

<sup>36</sup> Simon and those who were with him searched for him. 

<sup>37</sup> They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.” 

<sup>38</sup> He said to them, “Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.” 

<sup>39</sup> He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. 

<sup>40</sup> A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.” 

<sup>41</sup> Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I want to. Be made clean.” 

<sup>42</sup> When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean. 

<sup>43</sup> He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out, 

<sup>44</sup> and said to him, “See that you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” 

<sup>45</sup> But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.
