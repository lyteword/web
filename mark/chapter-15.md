# Chapter 15

**¹** Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.

**²** Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered,  “So you say.”

**³** The chief priests accused him of many things.

**⁴** Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”

**⁵** But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.

**⁶** Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him.

**⁷** There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.

**⁸** The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.

**⁹** Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”

**¹⁰** For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.

**¹¹** But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.

**¹²** Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”

**¹³** They cried out again, “Crucify him!”

**¹⁴** Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”

**¹⁵** Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.

**¹⁶** The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.

**¹⁷** They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.

**¹⁸** They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”

**¹⁹** They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.

**²⁰** When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.

**²¹** They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.

**²²** They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”

**²³** They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.

**²⁴** Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.

**²⁵** It was the third hour[^854] when they crucified him.

**²⁶** The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

**²⁷** With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.

**²⁸** The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”[^855]

**²⁹** Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,

**³⁰** save yourself, and come down from the cross!”

**³¹** Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.

**³²** Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”[^856] Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.

**³³** When the sixth hour[^857] had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.[^858]

**³⁴** At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,  “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted,  “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” [^859]

**³⁵** Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”

**³⁶** One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”

**³⁷** Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.

**³⁸** The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.

**³⁹** When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”

**⁴⁰** There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

**⁴¹** who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

**⁴²** When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,

**⁴³** Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.

**⁴⁴** Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.

**⁴⁵** When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

**⁴⁶** He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.

**⁴⁷** Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
