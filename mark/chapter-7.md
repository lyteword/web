# Chapter 7

**¹** Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.

**²** Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.

**³** (For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.

**⁴** They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)

**⁵** The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”

**⁶** He answered them,  “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,  ‘This people honors me with their lips,  but their heart is far from me.

**⁷**  They worship me in vain,  teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’[^816]

**⁸**  “For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”

**⁹** He said to them,  “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.

**¹⁰**  For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’[^817]  and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’[^818]

**¹¹**  But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,”’”[^819] that is to say, given to God,

**¹²**  “then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,

**¹³**  making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”

**¹⁴** He called all the multitude to himself and said to them,  “Hear me, all of you, and understand.

**¹⁵**  There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.

**¹⁶**  If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”[^820]

**¹⁷** When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.

**¹⁸** He said to them,  “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,

**¹⁹**  because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”[^821]

**²⁰** He said,  “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.

**²¹**  For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,

**²²**  covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.

**²³**  All these evil things come from within and defile the man.”

**²⁴** From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.

**²⁵** For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.

**²⁶** Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.

**²⁷** But Jesus said to her,  “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

**²⁸** But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”

**²⁹** He said to her,  “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”

**³⁰** She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.

**³¹** Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis.

**³²** They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.

**³³** He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue.

**³⁴** Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him,  “Ephphatha!”  that is,  “Be opened!”

**³⁵** Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.

**³⁶** He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.

**³⁷** They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”
