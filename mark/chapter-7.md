# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault. 

<sup>3</sup> (For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. 

<sup>4</sup> They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) 

<sup>5</sup> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” 

<sup>6</sup> He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 

<sup>7</sup> They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ 

<sup>8</sup> “For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.” 

<sup>9</sup> He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. 

<sup>10</sup> For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’ 

<sup>11</sup> But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,”’” that is to say, given to God, 

<sup>12</sup> “then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother, 

<sup>13</sup> making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this.” 

<sup>14</sup> He called all the multitude to himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand. 

<sup>15</sup> There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. 

<sup>16</sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!” 

<sup>17</sup> When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable. 

<sup>18</sup> He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him, 

<sup>19</sup> because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?” 

<sup>20</sup> He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. 

<sup>21</sup> For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, 

<sup>22</sup> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. 

<sup>23</sup> All these evil things come from within and defile the man.” 

<sup>24</sup> From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. 

<sup>25</sup> For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. 

<sup>26</sup> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. 

<sup>27</sup> But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 

<sup>28</sup> But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 

<sup>29</sup> He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” 

<sup>30</sup> She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out. 

<sup>31</sup> Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis. 

<sup>32</sup> They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. 

<sup>33</sup> He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue. 

<sup>34</sup> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!” 

<sup>35</sup> Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. 

<sup>36</sup> He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. 

<sup>37</sup> They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”
