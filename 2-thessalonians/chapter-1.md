# Chapter 1

**¹** Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

**²** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**³** We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,[^1274] even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you toward one another abounds,

**⁴** so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.

**⁵** This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of God’s Kingdom, for which you also suffer.

**⁶** For it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,

**⁷** and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,

**⁸** punishing those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,

**⁹** who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

**¹⁰** when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be admired among all those who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.

**¹¹** To this end we also pray always for you that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith with power,

**¹²** that the name of our Lord Jesus[^1275] may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

[^1274]: 1:3 The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
[^1275]: 1:12 TR adds “Christ”
