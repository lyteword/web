# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality. 

<sup>2</sup> For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in, 

<sup>3</sup> and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing and say, “Sit here in a good place;” and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool” 

<sup>4</sup> haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? 

<sup>5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? 

<sup>6</sup> But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you and personally drag you before the courts? 

<sup>7</sup> Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called? 

<sup>8</sup> However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well. 

<sup>9</sup> But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. 

<sup>10</sup> For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. 

<sup>11</sup> For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not commit murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. 

<sup>12</sup> So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by the law of freedom. 

<sup>13</sup> For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 

<sup>14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? 

<sup>15</sup> And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, 

<sup>16</sup> and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? 

<sup>17</sup> Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. 

<sup>18</sup> Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works. 

<sup>19</sup> You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe—and shudder. 

<sup>20</sup> But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? 

<sup>21</sup> Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 

<sup>22</sup> You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected. 

<sup>23</sup> So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. 

<sup>24</sup> You see then that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith. 

<sup>25</sup> In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? 

<sup>26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
