# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings. 

<sup>2</sup> Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations, 

<sup>3</sup> knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 

<sup>4</sup> Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 

<sup>5</sup> But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 

<sup>6</sup> But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. 

<sup>7</sup> For that man shouldn’t think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 

<sup>9</sup> Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; 

<sup>10</sup> and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away. 

<sup>11</sup> For the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass; and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So the rich man will also fade away in his pursuits. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is a person who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love him. 

<sup>13</sup> Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God can’t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. 

<sup>14</sup> But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. 

<sup>15</sup> Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin. The sin, when it is full grown, produces death. 

<sup>16</sup> Don’t be deceived, my beloved brothers. 

<sup>17</sup> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation nor turning shadow. 

<sup>18</sup> Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. 

<sup>19</sup> So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; 

<sup>20</sup> for the anger of man doesn’t produce the righteousness of God. 

<sup>21</sup> Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 

<sup>22</sup> But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves. 

<sup>23</sup> For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror; 

<sup>24</sup> for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 

<sup>25</sup> But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does. 

<sup>26</sup> If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn’t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless. 

<sup>27</sup> Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
