# Chapter 3

**¹** Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.

**²** For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.

**³** Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.

**⁴** Behold,[^1365] the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.

**⁵** So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!

**⁶** And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.[^1366]

**⁷** For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;

**⁸** but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

**⁹** With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God.

**¹⁰** Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.

**¹¹** Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?

**¹²** Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.

**¹³** Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.

**¹⁴** But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.

**¹⁵** This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.

**¹⁶** For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.

**¹⁷** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

**¹⁸** Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

[^1365]: 3:4 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
[^1366]: 3:6 or, Hell
