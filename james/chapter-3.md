# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.

<sup>2</sup> For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.

<sup>3</sup> Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.

<sup>4</sup> Behold,[^1365] the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.

<sup>5</sup> So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!

<sup>6</sup> And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.[^1366]

<sup>7</sup> For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;

<sup>8</sup> but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

<sup>9</sup> With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God.

<sup>10</sup> Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.

<sup>11</sup> Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?

<sup>12</sup> Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.

<sup>13</sup> Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.

<sup>14</sup> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.

<sup>15</sup> This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.

<sup>16</sup> For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.

<sup>17</sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

<sup>18</sup> Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

[^1365]: 3:4 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
[^1366]: 3:6 or, Hell
