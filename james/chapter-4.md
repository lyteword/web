# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members? 

<sup>2</sup> You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. 

<sup>3</sup> You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. 

<sup>4</sup> You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 

<sup>5</sup> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? 

<sup>6</sup> But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” 

<sup>7</sup> Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 

<sup>8</sup> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. 

<sup>9</sup> Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 

<sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. 

<sup>11</sup> Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. 

<sup>12</sup> Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? 

<sup>13</sup> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.” 

<sup>14</sup> Yet you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. 

<sup>15</sup> For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.” 

<sup>16</sup> But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil. 

<sup>17</sup> To him therefore who knows to do good and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.
