# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” 

<sup>3</sup> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “So you say.” 

<sup>4</sup> Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” 

<sup>5</sup> But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.” 

<sup>6</sup> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 

<sup>7</sup> When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. 

<sup>8</sup> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. 

<sup>9</sup> He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. 

<sup>10</sup> The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. 

<sup>11</sup> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. 

<sup>13</sup> Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 

<sup>14</sup> and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. 

<sup>15</sup> Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. 

<sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 

<sup>17</sup> Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast. 

<sup>18</sup> But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— 

<sup>19</sup> one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. 

<sup>20</sup> Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, 

<sup>21</sup> but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” 

<sup>22</sup> He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” 

<sup>23</sup> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. 

<sup>24</sup> Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. 

<sup>25</sup> He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. 

<sup>26</sup> When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. 

<sup>28</sup> But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 

<sup>29</sup> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ 

<sup>30</sup> Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’ 

<sup>31</sup> For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?” 

<sup>32</sup> There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. 

<sup>33</sup> When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. 

<sup>35</sup> The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!” 

<sup>36</sup> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, 

<sup>37</sup> and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” 

<sup>38</sup> An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” 

<sup>39</sup> One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!” 

<sup>40</sup> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? 

<sup>41</sup> And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” 

<sup>42</sup> He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” 

<sup>43</sup> Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” 

<sup>44</sup> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

<sup>45</sup> The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. 

<sup>46</sup> Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last. 

<sup>47</sup> When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” 

<sup>48</sup> All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their chests. 

<sup>49</sup> All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things. 

<sup>50</sup> Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man 

<sup>51</sup> (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom. 

<sup>52</sup> This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. 

<sup>53</sup> He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. 

<sup>54</sup> It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. 

<sup>55</sup> The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. 

<sup>56</sup> They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
