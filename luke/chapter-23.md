# Chapter 23

**¹** The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.

**²** They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”

**³** Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him,  “So you say.”

**⁴** Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”

**⁵** But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”

**⁶** But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

**⁷** When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.

**⁸** Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.

**⁹** He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.

**¹⁰** The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.

**¹¹** Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.

**¹²** Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.

**¹³** Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,

**¹⁴** and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.

**¹⁵** Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.

**¹⁶** I will therefore chastise him and release him.”

**¹⁷** Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.[^933]

**¹⁸** But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—

**¹⁹** one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.

**²⁰** Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,

**²¹** but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”

**²²** He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”

**²³** But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.

**²⁴** Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.

**²⁵** He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.

**²⁶** When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus.

**²⁷** A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.

**²⁸** But Jesus, turning to them, said,  “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

**²⁹**  For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’

**³⁰**  Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’[^934]

**³¹**  For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”

**³²** There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.

**³³** When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.

**³⁴** Jesus said,  “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.

**³⁵** The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”

**³⁶** The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,

**³⁷** and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”

**³⁸** An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

**³⁹** One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”

**⁴⁰** But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?

**⁴¹** And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”

**⁴²** He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”

**⁴³** Jesus said to him,  “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

**⁴⁴** It was now about the sixth hour,[^935] and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.[^936]

**⁴⁵** The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.

**⁴⁶** Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,  “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.

**⁴⁷** When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”

**⁴⁸** All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their chests.

**⁴⁹** All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things.

**⁵⁰** Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man

**⁵¹** (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom.

**⁵²** This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.

**⁵³** He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.

**⁵⁴** It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.

**⁵⁵** The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.

**⁵⁶** They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
