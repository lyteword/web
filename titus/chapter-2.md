# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> But say the things which fit sound doctrine, 

<sup>2</sup> that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance, 

<sup>3</sup> and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, 

<sup>4</sup> that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, 

<sup>5</sup> to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. 

<sup>6</sup> Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. 

<sup>7</sup> In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, 

<sup>8</sup> and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. 

<sup>9</sup> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, 

<sup>10</sup> not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. 

<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 

<sup>12</sup> instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; 

<sup>13</sup> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 

<sup>14</sup> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. 

<sup>15</sup> Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.
