# Chapter 2

**¹** But say the things which fit sound doctrine,

**²** that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance,

**³** and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good,

**⁴** that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children,

**⁵** to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.

**⁶** Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded.

**⁷** In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,

**⁸** and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.

**⁹** Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting,

**¹⁰** not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.

**¹¹** For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,

**¹²** instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;

**¹³** looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,

**¹⁴** who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.

**¹⁵** Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.
