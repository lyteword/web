# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, 

<sup>2</sup> in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; 

<sup>3</sup> but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior, 

<sup>4</sup> to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. 

<sup>5</sup> I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— 

<sup>6</sup> if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. 

<sup>7</sup> For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; 

<sup>8</sup> but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, 

<sup>9</sup> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him. 

<sup>10</sup> For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 

<sup>11</sup> whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. 

<sup>12</sup> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” 

<sup>13</sup> This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 

<sup>14</sup> not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 

<sup>15</sup> To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. 

<sup>16</sup> They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
