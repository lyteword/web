# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,

<sup>2</sup> to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.

<sup>3</sup> For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

<sup>4</sup> But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,

<sup>5</sup> not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,

<sup>6</sup> whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior;

<sup>7</sup> that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

<sup>8</sup> This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;

<sup>9</sup> but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

<sup>10</sup> Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,

<sup>11</sup> knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.

<sup>12</sup> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.

<sup>13</sup> Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.

<sup>14</sup> Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.

<sup>15</sup> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
