# Titus 3 

**¹** Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,

**²** to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.

**³** For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

**⁴** But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,

**⁵** not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,

**⁶** whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior;

**⁷** that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

**⁸** This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;

**⁹** but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

**¹⁰** Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,

**¹¹** knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.

**¹²** When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.

**¹³** Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.

**¹⁴** Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.

**¹⁵** All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
