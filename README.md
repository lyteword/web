> The World English Bible is an update of the American Standard Version of 1901, which is in the Public Domain. It has been edited to conform to the Greek Majority Text New Testament where there are significant differences in manuscripts. There are some places where the original textual basis decisions made by the ASV translators remain in place, but none of those have any significant effect on meaning. This revision is also in the Public Domain, which sets it apart from other revisions of the American Standard Version, like the New American Standard Bible, the Revised Standard Version, and their descendants. The first pass of the translation was to convert archaic words and word forms to modern equivalents using a custom computer program.
>   
> Manual editing was then done to add quotation marks (the ASV of 1901 had none), update other punctuation, update usage, and spot check the translation against the original languages in places where the meaning is unclear or significant textual variants exist. Many people proofread the work and send typo reports and suggestions in. These were reviewed, and if they were found to have merit, edits were made. Sometimes reviewing a suggestion brings to light a better option. As this was going on, the draft at the WEB web page was updated. Edits are now complete, although actual errors may still be corrected if found and verified.
