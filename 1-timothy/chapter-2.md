# Chapter 2

**¹** I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men,

**²** for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.

**³** For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,

**⁴** who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.

**⁵** For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

**⁶** who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,

**⁷** to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

**⁸** I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.

**⁹** In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not[^1278] with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,

**¹⁰** but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.

**¹¹** Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.

**¹²** But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.

**¹³** For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

**¹⁴** Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;

**¹⁵** but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.

[^1278]: 2:9 The word for “not” is the negative particle “μη” which denies an expected idea, as opposed to the usual word for “not” (ου) which denies a fact. Thus “μη” in this context is denying an expected idea (that women can be properly dressed without good works).
