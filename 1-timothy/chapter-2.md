# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men, 

<sup>2</sup> for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence. 

<sup>3</sup> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 

<sup>4</sup> who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>5</sup> For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time, 

<sup>7</sup> to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 

<sup>8</sup> I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting. 

<sup>9</sup> In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, 

<sup>10</sup> but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness. 

<sup>11</sup> Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission. 

<sup>12</sup> But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness. 

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 

<sup>14</sup> Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; 

<sup>15</sup> but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
